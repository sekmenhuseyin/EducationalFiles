</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
HyperTerminal is the Windows terminal-emulation program. It lets your powerful Windows computer--loaded with RAM, hard disk space, and other hardware--pretend to be a dumb terminal. HyperTerminal is useful for connecting to computers that are designed to talk to terminals, including <A HREF="../connecting/1.htm#5">UNIX shell accounts and bulletin board systems</A>. The computer you connect to by using HyperTerminal is called the <A NAME="ddremotecomputer"><I>remote computer</I></A> (as opposed to your own <A NAME="ddlocalcomputer"><I>local computer</I></A>).
<P>
You can use HyperTerminal in three ways:
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Dial-up connections </B>You can use HyperTerminal to call another computer over a modem and phone line. No other communications program or account is involved. You use this method when connecting directly to a bulletin board system, UNIX shell account, or other text-based system that works with terminals. You tell HyperTerminal what modem to use to make the connection, along with the country, area code, and phone number to dial.
<LI >
<B>Direct network connections </B>You can use HyperTerminal to connect to a computer to which your computer is connected by a cable. You tell HyperTerminal the communications port (COM1 or COM2) to which the cable is connected. Alternatively, you can use a <A HREF="../lans/7.htm#3">direct connection</A> in the Network Connections window.
<LI >
<B>Telnet connections </B>If you have an Internet account (or other TCP/IP-based connection), you can use HyperTerminal as a Winsock-compatible <A NAME="ddtelnet"><I>telnet</I></A> program, a terminal program that works over the Internet. First, you connect to the Internet by using a <A HREF="../connecting/2.htm#1">dial-up connection</A>. Then, you connect to a computer over the Internet by using a HyperTerminal telnet connection--you "telnet in." For example, you can look up books at the U.S. Library of Congress by making a telnet connection to the library's mainframe system and using its text-only interface. You tell HyperTerminal to connect using <A HREF="../connecting/0.htm#1">TCP/IP (Winsock)</A>, along with the port number and host address of the computer to which you want to connect. The standard <A NAME="ddportnumber"><I>port number</I></A> (a number that tells an Internet host computer whether you are connecting for e-mail, the Web, telnet, or another Internet service) is 23. The <A NAME="ddhostaddress"><I>host address</I></A> is the Internet host name of the computer you want to telnet in to; for example, the host address of the U.S. Library of Congress is <B>locis.loc.gov</B>.
</UL>
<P>
To dial up and connect to a computer, HyperTerminal creates a <A NAME="ddhyperterminalconnection"><I>HyperTerminal connection</I></A>, a <A HREF="../winsock/1.htm#3">configuration file</A> with the specifications for the connection. HyperTerminal connection files have the extension .ht.
<P>
Windows XP comes with HyperTerminal 5.1, which is very similar to the version that shipped with Windows Me/9x.

</OL>
<BR><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="winsock.hyperconnect2.png" WIDTH=296 HEIGHT=300 ALT="[image]">
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=2>
The options you see on this dialog box depend on what you've selected for the Connect using setting. For a dial-up connection, set the Connect Using box to the modem to use for the connection, choose the country, type the area code, and type the phone number to dial. For a direct cable connection, set the Connect Using box to your modem or to COM1 or COM2 (the communications port to which the modem is connected). For a telnet connection, set the Connect Using box to TCP/IP (Winsock, that is, your Internet connection) and fill in the host address and port number (usually 23).
<LI  VALUE=3>
Click OK. For dial-up connections, you see the Connect dialog box (for telnet connections, skip to step 6):

<LI  VALUE=5>
To connect, click Dial. (If you click Cancel, HyperTerminal remembers the connection information you entered, but doesn't make the connection.) For dial-up connections, HyperTerminal dials the phone. For telnet connections, if you're not already online, your dial-up connection may display its dialog box to get you connected to your Internet account; if so, click Connect. When HyperTerminal has established a connection with the remote computer, you see the HyperTerminal window, shown in Figure 26-2.

Log in and use the remote computer, typing the commands that the remote computer requires. For example, if the remote computer displays a UNIX command line, you must type UNIX commands. You can use the scroll bar along the right side of the HyperTerminal window to see the <A NAME="ddbackscrollbuffer"><I>backscroll buffer</I></A>, which stores the last 500 lines of text that have scrolled up off the top of the terminal window (you can configure the buffer to be larger).
<LI  VALUE=7>
When you are done using the remote computer, log off by using the commands that it requires. HyperTerminal disconnects, too. If you have trouble getting disconnected, tell HyperTerminal to hang up by choosing Call | Disconnect from the menu bar or by clicking the Disconnect icon on the toolbar.
<LI  VALUE=8>
When you exit HyperTerminal, it asks whether you want to save the session (connection) you just created. Click Yes. (If you never plan to connect to this remote computer again, click No to throw away the connection information you entered.) HyperTerminal creates an icon for the connection in the C:\Program Files\Accessories\HyperTerminal folder.

In the Properties dialog box for the connection, you can set these types of options:
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Connect using </B>On the Connect To tab, you specify the icon and how to connect: via modem, via cable (connected to your modem, COM1, or COM2 port), or via TCP/IP (for a telnet connection). For dial-up connections, you also specify the phone number. For TCP/IP connections, you also specify the host address and port number (the default is 23, telnet's usual port). If you have <A HREF="../lans/7.htm#16">Virtual Private Networking</A> installed, VPN appears as an option.
<LI >
<B>What keys do </B>On the Settings tab, you specify whether the function keys, cursor motion keys, and C<SMALL>TRL</SMALL> key combinations are transmitted to the other computer or are interpreted by Windows. You can also control the actions of the B<SMALL>ACKSPACE</SMALL> key.<LI >
<B>Terminal emulation </B>On the Settings tab, you tell HyperTerminal what type of terminal to emulate (act like). Most remote computers are configured to work with certain standard terminal types. HyperTerminal can emulate many of the most commonly used terminal types: ANSI, ANSIW, Minitel, TTY, Viewdata, VT100, VT100J, VT52, and VT-UTF8. If you set the Emulation box to Auto Detect, HyperTerminal tries to figure out what type of terminal to emulate, based on information from the remote computer. If you click the Terminal Setup button, you can further configure HyperTerminal's actions, including how the cursor looks, what keys on the keypad do, and whether the terminal window displays 80 or 132 columns.
<LI >
<B>Character set </B>On the Settings tab, click the Terminal Setup button to control settings that are specific to the type of terminal that you are emulating. Click the ASCII Setup button to control the characters that HyperTerminal sends and receives, including which character(s) HyperTerminal sends at the end of each line, whether HyperTerminal displays the characters you type or waits to display them until the remote computer echoes them back, and whether HyperTerminal waits a fraction of a second after each character or line it sends.

HyperTerminal can send files from your computer to the remote computer or receive files from the remote computer. A number of standard file transfer protocols exist; HyperTerminal can send and receive files by using the Xmodem (regular or 1K), Kermit, Ymodem, Ymodem-G, Zmodem, and Zmodem With Crash Recovery protocols. Choose a protocol that the remote computer can also handle. If you have a choice, use Zmodem With Crash Recovery.

To send a file to the remote computer:
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=1>
Connect to the remote computer. If applicable, move to the directory on the remote computer in which you want to store the file.
<LI  VALUE=2>
If the file transfer protocol you plan to use requires you to give a command on the remote computer to tell it to expect a file, do so. For example, when transferring a file to a UNIX system by using Xmodem, you type the command <B>rx </B><B><I>filename</I></B> on the remote computer. When transferring a file by using Zmodem (with or without Crash Recovery), no command is required; the UNIX system can detect when the file begins to arrive, and stores it automatically.
<LI  VALUE=3>
Click the Send button on the toolbar or choose Transfer | Send File. You see the Send File dialog box, shown here:

You might want to send text to the other computer as though you were typing it. For example, if the remote computer asks a question to which you have an answer stored in a small text file, you can send the text file rather than retyping it--the remote computer doesn't realize that you are sending a file, and accepts the text as though you typed it. You can also send text that is displayed by some other program; for example, you might want to send a number that is displayed in your spreadsheet program.
