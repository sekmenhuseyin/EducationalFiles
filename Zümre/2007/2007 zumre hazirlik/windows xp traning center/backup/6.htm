To restore files that you have backed up with the Backup Utility, you can use the Restore Wizard or you can select options yourself.

<TD VALIGN="TOP">The Backup Utility stores backed-up files in a special format, and you need to use Backup Utility to restore them. You can't just copy the files from an Explorer window back to where you want to use them. The Backup Utility can't restore backups made by other backup programs, either, including those made by the Windows Me/9x backup utilities.

To run the Backup Or Restore Wizard to help you restore one or more files, follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=1>
Start the Backup Utility. If the wizard doesn't start automatically, choose Tools | Switch To Wizard Mode from the menu bar.
<LI  VALUE=2>
When the wizard runs, choose Restore Files And Settings and click Next. You see the What To Restore window, containing two boxes: the one on the left shows the backup files and tapes available (Figure 9-11). Backups to file are listed under the File heading. Tape backups are listed under a heading that reflects the type of type (like miniQIC or Travan), and then by the tape.

<OL>
<LI  VALUE=3>
Double-click an item on the left to see the files and folders that it contains on the right. Click the boxes next to files and folders to put a check mark by those that you want to restore. Click Next when you have finished. You see the Completing The Backup Or Restore Wizard, but you're not done.
<LI  VALUE=4>
Click the Advanced button to display the Where To Restore window.
<LI  VALUE=5>
Set the Restore Files To box to Original Location to put the files back where they came from; Alternate Location to put the structure of restored files and folders in a folder you specify; or Single Folder to put all the restored files into a single folder, without restoring the structure of the folders that they used to be in. Click Next.
<LI  VALUE=6>
In the How To Restore window, choose what to do if restoring a file would overwrite an existing file. Choose Leave Existing Files, Replace Existing Files If They Are Older Than The Backup Files, or Replace Existing Files. Click Next. You see the Advanced Restore Options window.
<LI  VALUE=7>
If you are restoring files that were stored on an NTFS partition, you can select the Restore Security Settings check box to restore the permissions and ownership for the folders and files. (See Table 9-4 in the following section for information about the settings in steps 7-9.)
<LI  VALUE=8>
If you are restoring a <A HREF="../harddisks/3.htm#3">mounted drive</A>, select the Restore Junction Points But Not The Folders And File Data They Reference check box.
<LI  VALUE=9>
If you are restoring files and folders that contain mount points for mounted drives, deselect the Preserve Existing Volume Mount Points check box. If you have already set up the mount points for mounted drives and you don't want to disturb them, select this check box. Click Next.
<LI  VALUE=10>
You see the Completing The Backup Or Restore Wizard window again. Click Finish to restore the files.
</OL>
<P>
While the Backup Utility is restoring files, you see a Restore Progress window showing how many files have been restored and how many are yet to be restored. When it is finished, click the Report button to see the log file, or the Close button to close the window.

<OL>
<LI  VALUE=2>
Choose the files and folders to restore, as described in step 3 of the previous section.
<LI  VALUE=3>
The Restore Files To box is normally set to Original Location to restore the files and folders to the location from which they were backed up, in the same folder structure. You can change this setting to Alternate Location (to put the structure of restored files and folders in a folder you specify) or Single Folder (to put all the restored files into a single folder, without restoring the structure of the folders that they used to be in).
<LI  VALUE=4>
If you chose Alternate Location or Single Folder in the last step, set the Alternate Location box to the folder where you want to restore the files and folders.
<LI  VALUE=5>
Click the Start Restore button (you still have some other options to set). You see the Confirm Restore dialog box.
<LI  VALUE=6>
Click the Advanced button to choose other options for restoring files. Table 9-4 shows the advanced options available when restoring files. Click OK when you have finished.
