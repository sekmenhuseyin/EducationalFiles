<P>
Since the 1990s, the most common way to connect to the Internet has been via a dial-up modem that attaches to a regular phone line (or via a local area network, for computers in large organizations). Windows needs to know exactly which make of dial-up modem you have, so it can send the appropriate commands. You can also tell Windows from which area code you usually dial, from what other locations you make calls (if you have a portable computer), and to which calling cards you want to charge your calls.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3><B>What Does Windows Know About Your Modem?</B></FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
When you <A HREF="../hardware/5.htm#4">install a modem</A>, Windows either determines what kind of modem it is, or it asks you. Windows installs a <A NAME="ddmodemdriver"><I>modem driver</I></A>, a small program that usually comes with the modem (Windows comes with modem drivers for many popular modems).
<P>
You can look at or change your modem configuration settings by choosing Start | Control Panel, clicking Printers And Other Hardware, and then clicking Phone And Modems Options. (If Windows doesn't know you have a modem, the Add New Hardware Wizard runs. If your modem is external, make sure it is turned on, and then follow the Wizard's instructions to set up the modem.)
<P>
You see the Phone And Modem Options dialog box. Click the Modems tab to see a list of the installed modems, as shown in Figure 21-1. Select the appropriate modem from the list, and then click the Properties button to see the Properties dialog box for the modem, shown in Figure 21-2. (The exact appearance of the dialog box depends on which modem driver you select.) To find out which modem driver Windows uses for your modem, click the Driver tab in the modem's Properties dialog box.

<P>
Table 21-1 lists the modem properties that appear in the Properties dialog box for most modems. Table 21-2 shows additional settings that appear on the Default Preferences dialog box for the modem, which you display by clicking the Advanced tab on the modem's Properties dialog box, and then clicking the Change Default Preferences button. Except where noted, don't change these settings unless you are sure your modem is configured incorrectly. Most people never have to change these settings except in consultation with their modem manufacturer, communications software publisher, or Internet service provider.

If you have trouble getting your modem to connect, here are some things to check:
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Make sure the correct modem driver is installed.  </B>Look on the Modems tab of the Phone And Modems Options dialog box to make sure the correct modem is listed. Remove any modems that are no longer installed. If the wrong modem is listed, click Add to run the Add New Hardware Wizard and install the correct driver.
<LI >
<B>Make sure the modem driver is enabled.  </B>Choose Start, right-click My Computer, choose Manage, and choose <A HREF="../hardware/3.htm#1">Device Manager</A> from the list at the left side of the Computer Management window. Choose View | Devices By Type, and then click the plus (+) sign next to the Modems entry on the list of devices. Your modem should appear in the list: if it appears with an exclamation point or <I>X</I> on it, something is wrong. Click it and click the Properties button to display the Properties dialog box for the modem. On the General tab, make sure that Device Usage is set to Use This Device (Enabled).
<LI >
<B>Make sure the modem is connected to the correct port.  </B>Display the properties dialog box for the modem as described in the preceding paragraph. On the Modem or General tab, check that you see the <A HREF="../hardware/4.htm#3">port</A> to which the modem is connected.
<LI >
<B>Make sure the modem speed is right.  </B>On the Modem tab in the Properties dialog box for the modem, check the Maximum Port Speed setting. Choosing a lower speed may solve your connection problem.
</UL>
<P>
You can also use the Windows XP Modem Troubleshooter to help pinpoint the problem. To start the troubleshooter, click the General tab in the modem's Properties dialog box, and then click the Troubleshoot button. Follow the instructions in the Help And Support Center window that appears.
