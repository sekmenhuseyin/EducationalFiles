<P>
Windows Movie Maker is essentially the same program that came with Windows Me. It enables you to edit graphical, audio, and video files into movies that are stored in video files that you can play with <A HREF="../video/2.htm#1">Windows Media Player</A>.
<P>
Windows Movie Maker creates files called <A NAME="ddprojects"><I>projects</I></A>, with the extension .mswmm. Each project can contain one or more <A NAME="ddcollections"><I>collections</I></A>, which are lists of items to include in the movie. A collection contains <A HREF="clips"><I>clips</I></A>, which can be video, audio, or still-graphics files. Information about your collections is stored in your My Videos folder, which is in your My Documents folder. Once you've created your movie, you can save it as a video file in Windows Media format with the extension .wmv.

For graphics files, you see a small version of the file (a thumbnail). For audio files, you see a speaker icon. For video files, you see a thumbnail of a scene from the video.
<LI >
<B>Monitor</B>0x3fDisplays the current clip, if it's a graphic or video file. If the current clip is an audio file, you see a speaker icon. Below the Monitor are VCR-style buttons to play the current clip.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3><B>Importing Files</B></FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
Before you can create a movie, you need to import video, audio, and graphic information with which to make the movie. Depending on where your picture, sound, and video information come from, you need the appropriate hardware or access to get that information onto your computer. The three types of information you can import are:
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Video  </B>Some video equipment stores can copy your videotapes to CD-ROM, which you can then import into Windows Movie Maker. If you want to import your own video from a video camera or VCR, you need a video capture card. Both ATI (<A HREF="http://www.ati.com"><B>http://www.ati.com</B></A>) and Creative Labs (<A HREF="http://www.creativelabs.com"><B>http://www.creativelabs.com</B></A>) make reasonably priced video capture cards. You can also acquire video through a FireWire port by connecting it to a digital video camera. Windows Movie Maker can import .wmv, .asf, .avi, .mpg, and other video format files.
<LI >
<B>Audio</B>0x3fYou can capture audio with your computer by running the <A HREF="../audio/3.htm#1">Sound Recorder program</A>, or you can use <A HREF="../audio/4.htm#6">Windows Media Player</A> to capture music from audio CDs. Windows Media Player can import .mp3, .asf, .wma, .wav and other format audio files.
<LI >
<B>Still pictures</B>0x3fYou can use a <A HREF="../graphics/index.htm">digital camera or scanner</A> to capture still pictures in graphics files. You can also create drawings or titles using <A HREF="../graphics/5.htm#1">Microsoft Paint</A> or another graphics editor. Windows Movie Maker can import .gif, .jpg, and other types of graphic files.
</UL>
<P>
Once you have graphic, audio, or video files, you can import them into Windows Movie Maker. Follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=1>
Run Windows Movie Maker and open your project if it's not already open. To create a new project, choose File | New | Project from the menu bar.
<LI  VALUE=2>
Select the collection into which you want to import the files. You can create a new collection for them by selecting the top-level collection (My Collections) and choosing File | New | Collection from the menu.
<LI  VALUE=3>
Choose File | Import or press C<SMALL>TRL</SMALL>-I. You see the Select The File To Import dialog box.<LI  VALUE=4>
Select the file or files to import. You can select more than one file by holding the S<SMALL>HIFT</SMALL> or C<SMALL>TRL</SMALL> keys while selecting files.<LI  VALUE=5>
After a potentially grueling wait, the files are added to the active collection.
</OL>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/tip.png" ALT="tip" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=29></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Another way to import files is to drag-and-drop them into the Windows Movie Maker window.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
After you import information into the program, Windows Movie Maker shows each clip as a little icon in the current collection. You can find out more about any clip by right-clicking it and choosing Properties from the shortcut menu that appears. To play a single clip, select it and click the Play button on the VCR-style buttons just below the Monitor (the leftmost button).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/tip.png" ALT="tip" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=29></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">When you import a video file, Windows Movie Maker automatically breaks it into clips, based on where it thinks the scenes start and end. To turn this feature off, choose View | Options and deselect the Automatically Create Clips option.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
You can organize your clips into collections by dragging the clips from one collection to another, or by using cut-and-paste (C<SMALL>TRL</SMALL>-X to cut and C<SMALL>TRL</SMALL>-V to paste).<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/note.png" ALT="note" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=29></TD>

</TABLE></A>
<P>
The Workspace area at the bottom of the Windows Movie Maker window displays either the Storyboard or the Timeline. To create a movie out of your clips, you drag them to the Storyboard or Timeline in the order that you want them shown.
<P>
The <A NAME="ddstoryboard"><I>Storyboard</I></A> is like a book, in which each blank square is like the page of a book, and you decide what appears on each page and in what order. Find the first clip--either video or graphic file--and drag it to the first space in the Storyboard. This clip becomes the first page of your story, and the first part of your movie. Continue dragging video and graphic clips to the Storyboard in the order in which you want them to appear. You can always switch the order later. With clips, the Storyboard looks like this:
<BR><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="video.storyboard.png" WIDTH=317 HEIGHT=58 ALT="[image]">
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/tip.png" ALT="tip" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=29></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">To move clips around after you've placed them in the Storyboard, just drag them left or right. When a line appears between the clips where you would like to place the clip to be reordered, drop it.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The <A NAME="ddtimeline"><I>Timeline</I></A> gives you another view of the same movie. Display it in the Workspace area by clicking the Timeline icon at the left end of the Workspace (switch back to the Storyboard by clicking the Storyboard icon that takes the Timeline icon's place), or choose View | Timeline from the menu (View | Storyboard takes you back to the Storyboard). The Timeline shows the timing of the clips in the movie, displaying how many seconds each clip takes:
<BR><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="video.timeline.png" WIDTH=317 HEIGHT=69 ALT="[image]">
<P>
You can add, delete, and rearrange the clips on either the Storyboard or the Timeline--the effect is the same. If you delete a clip from the Storyboard or Timeline, it disappears from the movie, but remains in the project available for reuse. If you don't think you'll use a clip after all, you can delete by selecting it in the Clips area and pressing the D<SMALL>ELETE</SMALL> key--this action deletes the information from the project.<A NAME="5">

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
To provide a soundtrack, you can drag an audio clip to the Timeline (not the Storyboard). The audio clip runs along the bottom of the Timeline, showing where the audio starts and ends. You can control the balance between the sound portion of the video clips and of the audio soundtrack by choosing Edit | Audio Levels from the menu and sliding the slider between Video Track and Audio Track:
<BR><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="video.wmmaudio.png" WIDTH=297 HEIGHT=109 ALT="[image]">
<P>
You can record a narration to go with your slide show or video. The idea is to synchronize what you're saying with what's appearing on the screen. (Note: Your computer needs a working microphone to record the narration.) Follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=1>
Choose File | Record Narration to display the Record Narration Track dialog box.
<LI  VALUE=2>
If you want to mute the audio track during the playback of the movie, click the check box marked Mute Video Soundtrack.
<LI  VALUE=3>
When you're ready, click the Record button. Be prepared--as soon as you click the Record button, Windows Movie Maker begins recording and playing the video at the same time.
<LI  VALUE=4>
Talk along with the movie.
<LI  VALUE=5>
When you're finished, click the Stop button. Windows Movie Maker prompts you to save your narration and imports it into your project.

Windows Movie Maker includes many commands for editing your movie. Here are a few neat things you can do:
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Slide shows</B><B>0x3f</B>If you put a graphic file in your movie, Windows Movie Maker shows it for five seconds. You can make a good-looking slide show that you can send to people through e-mail, just by adding your still photos to the Storyboard of a movie. You can change the five-second length to speed up or slow down your slide show. On the Timeline, select the clip for the still photo. A pair of triangles appears along the top of the clip, one on each end. Drag the right-hand triangle to the right to add time to the clip, or to the left to subtract time from it.
<LI >
<B>Transitions</B><B>0x3f</B>You can create a fading transition from one video or picture to the next. Click the first clip of the pair. A pair of triangles appears along the top of the clip. Drag the right triangle into the next clip, so the clips appear to overlap:
</UL>
<BR><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="video.wmmfadeshow.png" WIDTH=317 HEIGHT=69 ALT="[image]">
<P>
The wider the overlap, the longer the transition will be. The resulting fade-in looks like Figure 20-4.

<TD VALIGN="TOP">Windows Movie Maker does not have integrated transition effects as other consumer-grade video editors do. You can't add special transitions other than the fade effect.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Titling</B><B>0x3f</B>Windows Movie Maker does not have commands to create titles (as some other video edition programs do). To add titles, choose Start | All Programs | Accessories | Paint to run <A HREF="../graphics/5.htm#1">Microsoft Paint</A>. Choose Image | Attributes and change the document size to a width of 320 pixels and a height of 240 pixels. Add anything to your title page or pages that you like. A basic black background with white lettering goes well with video presentations and is also easy to read. Save your document or documents using descriptive file names in a folder to import them into Windows Movie Maker.

</TABLE></A>
<P>
Once your movie shines, click the Save Movie button on the toolbar or choose File | Save Movie from the menu. You see the Save Movie dialog box. The Setting box in the Playback Quality section gives you four choices for quality. They are:
<UL>
<LI >
Low Quality
<LI >
Medium Quality (Recommended)
<LI >
High Quality
<LI >
Other (then choose a format in the Profile drop-down menu)
</UL>
<P>
As you set the Play Quality Setting, the File Size shows how large the resulting movie will be. The default is Medium Quality, which gives reasonable clarity and excellent sound. A collection of photographs and music that runs 30 seconds took a mere 791Kb of space at High Quality. It was 94Kb at Low Quality and 343Kb at Medium Quality, all of which are reasonable sizes when sending movies via e-mail. If you plan to make large movies with video, be aware that they can take up anywhere from several megabytes to several hundred megabytes of disk space.
<P>
Fill out the other information on the dialog box with as much or as little detail as you wish and click OK. In the Save As dialog box that appears, enter a name for the file. Windows Movie Maker saves the movie in a file with the .wmv extension.

<P>
You can e-mail your movies or send them to your Web server directly from Windows Movie Maker. To send a movie via e-mail or the Web, click the Send button on the toolbar or choose File | Send Movie To from the menu. Select E-mail or Web Server from the menu that appears. Choose the quality for the resulting video and fill out the other information on the dialog box. When you click OK, Windows Movie Maker asks which e-mail program to use. Select either Default E-mail Program at the top of the list or the name of the program you typically use from the items below. If you plan to send the videos using a different program another time, leave the Don't Ask Me Again item unchecked. Click OK. Your e-mail program opens and a new message appears, waiting for you to enter the addresses of those you wish to send it to.
