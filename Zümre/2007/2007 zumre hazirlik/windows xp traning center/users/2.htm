</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
When two or more users share a computer, they don't have to argue about what color the background should be, what programs should be on the Start menu, or whether to use single-click or double-click style. Instead, each user can have a <A NAME="dduseraccount"><I>user account</I></A> (called a <I>user profile</I> in previous versions of Windows). User accounts can be stored in one of two places:
<UL>
<LI >
<B><A NAME="ddlocaluseraccounts">Local user accounts</A></B>  Information about a local user account is stored a folder in the C:\Documents And Settings folder that contains files that describe each user's preferences. Each time a user logs on, Windows finds the appropriate user account and makes the appropriate changes. If you change any of your preferences (for example, choosing a new wallpaper), that information is stored in your user account, so that the change will still be there the next time you log on, but not the next time someone else logs on. Whenever your computer acquires a new user, you should <A HREF="../users/3.htm#1">establish a new user account</A>. User accounts enable several people to share one computer, or to share folders and other resources on a LAN.
<LI >
<B><A NAME="dddomainaccounts">Domain accounts</A></B>  Information about domain accounts is stored by the Active Directory (AD) program running on a Windows NT, 2000, or .NET server. When you log in using a domain, your computer gets information from Active Directory about what your settings are and what you have permission to do. Domain accounts are used on larger networks where maintaining accounts stored in each individual computer would be impractical. Domain accounts can use <A NAME="ddroaminguserprofiles"><I>roaming user profiles</I></A>, which allow people to use their own user account from any computer on a LAN, and <A NAME="ddmandatoryuserprofiles"><I>mandatory user profiles</I></A>, in which only administrators can make changes.
</UL>
<P>
A new feature in Windows XP (new to Windows Me/9x users, anyway) enables you to <A HREF="../users/5.htm#8">password-protect the files in your My Documents folder</A>, so that other people using the same computer later won't be able to read them. Each user's My Documents folder can be protected from view from the other users.
<P>
Another new feature protects your computer if you don't assign passwords to your user accounts. If your user account doesn't have a password, you can log on to your account only at your own computer: you can't use Run As (described in the section "<A HREF="../users/5.htm#10">Running a Program as Another User</A>" later in this chapter) or <A HREF="../mobile/3.htm#1">Remote Desktop</A> to use the computer with your user account.
<P>
If your computer is on a small LAN, you can set up local user accounts on all the computers on the LAN so that people can use any computer and see their own files and desktop. See <A HREF="../sharehw/index.htm">Chapter 29</A> for details.

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
Windows XP Home Edition and Professional enable you to set up local user accounts. If you are logged into a Windows .NET, 2000, or NT server with administrative privileges, you can create and maintain domain accounts on a domain-based LAN, but you should talk to your LAN administrator before doing so.
<P>
Windows provides three types of local user accounts:
<UL>
<LI >
<A NAME="ddadministrator"><B>Administrator</B></A><B>  </B>Enables access to all accounts. Each computer needs at least one administrator account at all times. You can have more than one, if you like. When using an administrator account, you can give commands to create, edit, and delete all user accounts, and you can install software. Windows XP comes with one administrator account named Owner (in Windows XP Home Edition) or Administrator (in Windows XP Professional). Microsoft recommends that you use it only for installing programs and managing the system.<B></B>
<LI >
<A NAME="ddlimited"><B>Limited</B></A><B>  </B>Enables access to your own account. When using a limited account, you cannot install software, open files in other people's My Documents folders, change system settings, or change other people's user accounts. You can run programs that are already installed, and you can modify your own user account (except that you can't change it into an administrator account). You should log on with a limited account for day-to-day work, to avoid viruses and other programs that might try to install themselves when you aren't looking.
<LI >
<A NAME="ddguest"><B>Guest</B></A><B>  </B>Enables access only to programs that are installed on the computer. Each Windows XP has one guest account (named Guest). When using the guest account, you cannot change the any user accounts, open files in other people's My Documents folders, or install software.<B></B>
</UL>
<P>
You can create as many administrator or limited accounts as you want. You can't create guest accounts. When you install Windows XP, there are at least two accounts:
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Owner or Administrator</B>  An administrator account (in Windows XP Home Edition, it's called Owner, and in Windows XP Professional, it's called Administrator). In the rest of this chapter, we'll refer to this account as Administrator.<B></B>
<LI >
<B>Guest</B>  The guest account.
</UL>
<P>
The installation program asks for the names of the people who will use the computer, and creates an administrator account for each name. You can create additional administrative or limited accounts for each person who uses the computer, and you can rename or delete the Administrator account. Until you create other accounts and passwords, you automatically log on as Administrator when you start Windows. For how to create new accounts, see "<A HREF="../users/4.htm#2">Creating New User Accounts</A>" later in this chapter.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/caution.png" ALT="caution" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=29></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">If you are concerned about security (as you should be, if your computer connects to the Internet), disable the Guest account (see the section "<A HREF="../users/4.htm#9">Enabling and Disabling the Guest Account</A>" later in this chapter). Also be sure to create passwords for each user account, as described in the section "<A HREF="../users/4.htm#8">Adding or Removing Passwords</A>" later in this chapter. Change all but one or two rarely used accounts from administrator to limited accounts, to reduce security holes.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3><B>What Are Groups?</B></FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
Each user account is a member of one or more <A NAME="ddgroups"><I>groups</I></A>, which define what the user can do. A user account can be a member of many groups. You can create new groups and you can add user accounts to groups. Groups can be <A NAME="ddlocalgroups"><I>local groups</I></A> (stored on your own computer) or <A NAME="dddomaingroups"><I>domain groups</I></A> (stored as part of a Microsoft Active Directory system on a Windows .NET Server).
<P>
(If you need to create and modify groups, you probably have a LAN with a large enough number of computers to warrant at least one computer running Windows .NET Server, with domain-based accounts--see <I>Windows .NET Server: The Complete Reference</I> for information.)
<P>
Each group comes with <A NAME="ddrights"><I>rights</I></A> that allow members of that group to perform system-wide tasks, like installing or running programs. A user account has all the rights of all the groups to which it belongs. Groups also have <A HREF="../users/2.htm#8">permissions</A> to use certain files and folders.
<P>
Windows XP Professional comes with nine built-in groups, but for user accounts on a single computer, you usually use only three of them (see the preceding section for descriptions of what each type of user account can do). User accounts belong to these groups:

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
Windows Me/9x had no provision for users keeping files private from each other. Like Windows NT and 2000, Windows XP does, as long as three things are true:
<UL>
<LI >
The disk on which the files are stored is formatted using <A HREF="../harddisks/1.htm#6">NTFS</A>. If your disk is formatted as FAT32 instead of NTFS, you can set up local user accounts and groups, but you can't make files or folders private.
<LI >
<A HREF="../users/2.htm#7">Simple File Sharing</A> is disabled, as described in the next section.
<LI >
You have Windows XP Professional rather than Windows XP Home Edition.
</UL>
<P>
Each user account has its own My Documents folder in which the user can store files. Other users can't open the folder to see the files. Choose Start | My Documents to see the contents of your My Documents folder.
<P>
Windows usually stores the My Documents folders for all local user accounts in the C:\Documents And Settings folder. When you <A HREF="../users/4.htm#8">create a password</A> for your account, Windows asks if you want a private documents folder. If you click Yes, your My Documents folder can only be opened by you, and by administrative users. If you click No, anyone can open your My Documents folder. (If an administrator creates a new user account, Windows creates the private My Documents folder right away.)
<P>
When you are logged on, the C:\Documents And Settings\<I>username</I>\My Documents folder appears as the My Documents folder. Other user's folders also appear, with names like Zac's Documents and Jordan's Documents. If you try to open a private My Documents folder, Windows displays an error message instead.
<P>
You can change the location of your My Document's folder; see the section "<A HREF="../users/4.htm#3">Modifying User Accounts</A>" later in this chapter. To control who has permission to use your My Documents folder--or other folders--see the section "<A HREF="../users/5.htm#8">Keeping Your Files Private</A>" later in this chapter.

</TABLE></A>
<P>
<A NAME="ddsimplefilesharing"><I>Simple File Sharing</I></A> is a new feature of Windows XP. When Simple File Sharing is enabled (which it is when you first install Windows) and when you share a drive or folder, you share that drive or folder with all user accounts on your computer. If you want to control who has access to drives and folders, you have to disable Simple File Sharing.

<TD VALIGN="TOP">You can't disable Simple File Sharing in Windows XP Home Edition, only in Windows XP Professional.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The advantage of leaving Simple File Sharing turned on is that you don't have to make a lot of choices when you decide to share files with other users of your computer, or with other people on your network (if your computer is connected to a local area network). However, if you want to be able to give access to some people but not to others, you need to turn Simple File Sharing off.
<P>
Follow these steps to change the Simple File Sharing setting on your computer:
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=1>
Run Windows Explorer (choose Start | My Computer, for example).
<LI  VALUE=2>
Choose Tools | Folder Options to see the <A HREF="../exploring/7.htm#2">Folder Options dialog box</A>.
<LI  VALUE=3>
Click the View tab.
<LI  VALUE=4>
Scroll to the bottom of the Advanced Settings box to find the Use Simple File Sharing check box, and select or deselect the check box.
<LI  VALUE=5>
Click OK to close the dialog box.
</OL>
<P>
The other requirement for granting permissions for files or folders to individual users is that the files or folders be stored on an NTFS disk or partition. When Simple File Sharing is disabled you see security options when you share a drive or folder, and the Properties dialog box for drives and folders includes a Security tab. However, the options you see depend on whether the drive that you are sharing is formatted with NTFS or FAT32.

Windows supports permissions only if Simple File Sharing (described in the previous section) is disabled and if you files are stored on an <A HREF="../harddisks/1.htm#6">NTFS drive</A>. Table 6-3 lists the permissions you can set for folders, and Table 6-4 lists permissions for files. There are other permissions that are not frequently used except in domain-based networks. Each permission either allows or prevents users from performing the operation. To change the permissions for files and folders (assuming that you have permission yourself to do so), see the section "<A HREF="../users/5.htm#8">Keeping Your Files Private</A>" later in this chapter.

<P>
If a file or folder is stored on an NTFS drive or partition, and if you have <A HREF="../users/2.htm#7">Simple File Sharing</A> disabled, then the Properties dialog box for the file or folder includes a Security tab (as described in the section "<A HREF="../sharehw/3.htm#7">Setting User Permissions for NTFS Drives</A>" in Chapter 29). When you look at the Security tab of the Properties dialog box for a file or folder, you see the short list of permissions shown in Table 6-5. Each entry on the list represents a group of the permissions listed in Tables 6-3 and 6-4.

<P>
<A NAME="ddfastuserswitching"><I>Fast User Switching</I></A> is a new feature of Windows XP that allows you to switch from one user account to another without the first user logging off. For example, a user named Jordan might be running Outlook Express and Microsoft Access. Another user named Meg needs to check her mail and asks to use the computer. Fast User Switching lets Jordan step aside and Meg switch the computer to her user account. Jordan's programs are on hold until Meg is done using the computer. When Jordan switches back to his account, his programs are just where he left them.
<P>
Fast User Switching is enabled by default if your Windows system has at least 64MB of RAM. With less RAM, the system doesn't have enough space to store one user's environment, including its running programs and open files, while another user is active.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/note.png" ALT="note" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=29></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">You can't use Fast User Switching if your computer is part of a domain (that is, connected to a domain-based LAN). You also can't use it if you use the <A HREF="../users/3.htm#4">Classic logon screen</A> instead of the Welcome screen for logging on.
