Most of the options to change the way the keyboard accepts input are found on the Keyboard tab of the Accessibility Options dialog box, shown in Figure 16-1. Choose Start | Control Panel | Accessibility Options, run the Accessibility Options program, and click the Keyboard tab if it's not selected.

<P>
If you have trouble holding down two keys at once, activate <A NAME="ddstickykeys"><I>StickyKeys</I></A>, so you can press the keys separately and still get the same effect. When StickyKeys is on, you can save a document (for instance) by pressing the C<SMALL>TRL</SMALL> key, and then pressing the <I><TT>S</TT></I> key--you needn't press them at the same time. Pressing a second key turns off (or unsticks) the first key. StickyKeys works only with the <A NAME="ddmodifierkeys"><I>modifier keys</I></A>: S<SMALL>HIFT</SMALL>, W<SMALL>INDOWS</SMALL>, C<SMALL>TRL</SMALL>, and A<SMALL>LT</SMALL>.<P>

<TD VALIGN="TOP">The A<SMALL>LT</SMALL> key is sticky all the time--to choose a command from a menu bar, you can press and release the A<SMALL>LT</SMALL> key before you press the letter for the command.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
To turn on StickyKeys, select the Use StickyKeys check box on the Keyboard tab of the Accessibility Options dialog box. Then, click the Settings button to see five check boxes that define exactly how StickyKeys works:
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Use Shortcut  </B>Turns StickyKeys on or off when you press S<SMALL>HIFT</SMALL> five times.<LI >
<B>Press Modifier Key Twice To Lock  </B>Lock on a modifier key when you press it twice. Turn off the key by pressing it once again.
<LI >
<B>Turn StickyKeys Off If Two Keys Are Pressed At Once  </B>If two keys are pressed at once, StickyKeys turns off. To make a modifier key sticky again, StickyKeys must be turned on again by using the shortcut (if the Use Shortcut option is selected) or by displaying the Keyboard tab of the Accessibility Options dialog box and selecting the Use StickyKeys option. This option can be annoying if you ever want to press two keys at the same time.
<LI >
<B>Make Sounds When Modifier Key Is Pressed  </B>Beeps when a modifier key is struck. This is particularly useful when the previous option is turned on--it lets you know when StickyKeys is turned off.
<LI >
<B>Show StickyKeys Status On Screen  </B>Displays a small graphic to the left of the time in the notification area of the taskbar, as shown in the following illustration.

The four blocks represent the four modifier keys: S<SMALL>HIFT</SMALL> at the top, C<SMALL>TRL</SMALL> at the bottom left, W<SMALL>INDOWS</SMALL> in the bottom middle, and A<SMALL>LT</SMALL> at the bottom right. When a modifier key is stuck, its block is shaded on the diagram. You can double-click the icon to display the Accessibilities Options dialog box and make changes to your settings. When StickyKeys is off, the diagram is removed from the taskbar.</UL>

</TABLE></A>
<P>
If you have trouble typing each letter only once, you may want to turn on <A NAME="ddfilterkeys"><I>FilterKeys</I></A>--which "filters out" extra keystrokes--rather than spending time editing them out yourself. You can configure FilterKeys to ignore repeated keystrokes repeated too quickly and to slow down the repeat rate (the rate at which a character is repeated when a key is held down).
<P>
To turn on FilterKeys, select the Use FilterKeys check box on the Keyboard tab of the Accessibility Options dialog box. Then, click the Settings button to define exactly how FilterKeys works:
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Use Shortcut  </B>Turns FilterKeys on or off when you hold down the right S<SMALL>HIFT</SMALL> key for eight seconds.<LI >
<B>Ignore Repeated Keystrokes  </B>Ignores keys repeated without a sufficient pause (sometimes called <A NAME="ddbouncekeys"><I>BounceKeys</I></A>). When you choose this option, click the Settings button next to it, and then define the interval within which repeated keys should be ignored. Getting the right interval is crucial to avoiding frustration, so use the Test Area box to type words with repeated letters to see whether the setting works for you.<B></B>
<LI >
<B>Ignore Quick Keystrokes And Slow Down The Repeat Rate  </B>This option enables features called SlowKeys and RepeatKeys. <A NAME="ddslowkeys"><I>SlowKeys</I></A> enables you to filter out keys that are pressed only briefly. When SlowKeys is on, you must type more methodically, but Windows ignores keys touched lightly or quickly. <A NAME="ddrepeatkeys"><I>RepeatKeys</I></A> enables you to change the <A HREF="../keymouse/1.htm#2">way keys are repeated</A>--normally, if you hold down a key, it repeats at a certain rate after it has been held down for a certain interval. The settings for SlowKeys and RepeatKeys are on the same dialog box. Choose the radio button and click the Settings button next to it to configure them--if holding down a key causes it to repeat; if so, after what interval and at what rate should it repeat; and how long a key should be held down to register.
<LI >
<B>Beep When Keys Pressed Or Accepted  </B>Tells Windows to beep when a key is pressed, and beep again when a key is accepted.
<LI >
<B>Show FilterKey Status On Screen  </B>Displays a small graphic to the left of the time on the system tray, as shown in the following illustration:<B></B>

<A NAME="ddtogglekeys"><I>ToggleKeys</I></A> is useful if you accidentally press keys that change the behavior of the keyboard. When ToggleKeys is turned on and you press C<SMALL>APS</SMALL> L<SMALL>OCK</SMALL>, N<SMALL>UM</SMALL> L<SMALL>OCK</SMALL>, or S<SMALL>CROLL</SMALL> L<SMALL>OCK</SMALL>, a tone sounds--a high-pitched tone when you turn C<SMALL>APS</SMALL> L<SMALL>OCK</SMALL>, N<SMALL>UM</SMALL> L<SMALL>OCK</SMALL>, or S<SMALL>CROLL</SMALL> L<SMALL>OCK</SMALL> on, and a low-pitched tone when you turn it off.<P>
To turn on ToggleKeys, select the Use ToggleKeys option on the Keyboard tab of the Accessibility Options dialog box. Click the Settings button to turn on the Use Shortcut setting, which enables you to turn ToggleKeys on or off by holding down the N<SMALL>UM</SMALL> L<SMALL>OCK</SMALL> key for five seconds.<A NAME="5">

<P>
If using the mouse or other pointing device is easier for you than typing on the keyboard, Windows can display a picture of a keyboard on the screen. You can use a mouse, joystick, pointing stick, or other pointing device to choose characters from the On-Screen Keyboard:
<BR><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="access.onscreen.png" WIDTH=612 HEIGHT=195 ALT="[image]">
<P>
To display the On-Screen Keyboard, choose Start | All Programs | Accessories | Accessibility | On-Screen Keyboard. The program displays an explanatory dialog box along with the On-Screen Keyboard. After reading it, click Do Not Show This Message Again, and then OK to dismiss the dialog box.
<P>
You can type by choosing the keys on the On-Screen Keyboard with your mouse in one of three ways (typing modes):
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Click To Select  </B>Click an on-screen key.<B></B>
<LI >
<B>Hover To Select  </B>Rest the mouse pointer on the on-screen key for the specified period of time. You can choose the amount of time the mouse pointer must "hover" before the key types.<B></B>
<LI >
<B>Joystick Or Key To Select  </B>Windows automatically moves the highlight from key to key on the On-Screen Keyboard, cycling endlessly across the keys. When the highlight gets to the key you want, press a key, click the mouse, or activate the joystick to select that key. You can choose how fast the highlight moves, what key or click chooses the selected key, and how your selection device is connected to the computer.<B></B>
</UL>
<P>
Choose your typing mode by choose Settings | Typing Mode from the menu bar at the top of the On-Screen Keyboard window.
<P>
The characters you "type" using the On-Screen Keyboard appear in the active window--be sure to select the window into which you want to type first. When you choose the "shft" button on the screen, it remains on until you choose the next button (for example, choose "shft" and then <I>a</I> to type a capital <I>A</I>).
<P>
You can choose:
<UL>
<LI >
Whether the keyboard appears "on top" of other windows that it overlaps, by choosing Settings | Always On Top
<LI >
Whether the on-screen "keys" make a sound when chosen, by choosing Settings | Use Click Sound
<LI >
What font appears on the keys of the On-Screen Keyboard, by choosing Settings | Font
<LI >
Whether to display the standard or enhanced keyboard (the enhanced keyboard includes the numeric keypad and more cursor movement keys), by choosing Keyboard | Enhanced Keyboard or Keyboard | Standard Keyboard
<LI >
Whether to arrange the keys like a real keyboard, or in a grid, by choosing Keyboard | Regular Layout or Keyboard | Block Layout
<LI >
How many keys to display, by choosing Keyboard | 101 Keys, Keyboard | 102 Keys (which adds a backslash key to the left of Z), or Keyboard | 106 Keys (which adds Japanese-language characters).
