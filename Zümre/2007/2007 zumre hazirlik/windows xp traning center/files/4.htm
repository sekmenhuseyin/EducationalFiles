<P>
Files and folders deleted from your hard drives don't go away completely, at least not right away--they remain inside the <A NAME="ddrecyclebin"><I>Recycle Bin</I></A>. From there, they can either be <A HREF="../files/9.htm#4">restored</A> to the folder they were in before you deleted them or moved from the Recycle Bin to any other folder via cut-and-paste or drag-and-drop.
<P>
The Recycle Bin icon lives on the desktop and looks like a wastebasket. When you <A HREF="../files/9.htm#5">open the icon</A>, Windows Explorer shows you the files and folders that were deleted since the Recycle Bin was last emptied.
<BR><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="files.recyclebin.png" WIDTH=65 HEIGHT=56 ALT="[image]">
<P>
The Recycle Bin is a hybrid object that behaves like a folder in some ways, but not in others. Like a folder, it contains objects, and you can move objects into and out of the Recycle Bin, just as you do with any other folder. Unlike a folder, even an unusual folder like the desktop, the Recycle Bin is not contained on a single drive. Instead, each of your computer's hard drives (or partitions of hard drives, if your drive is partitioned) maintains its own Recycle Bin.
<P>
Folders that have been sent to the Recycle Bin aren't considered part of the folder tree: They don't appear in the Folders Explorer bar, and they can't be opened. If you want to examine the contents of a folder in the Recycle Bin, you first must move the folder to another location. Likewise, files in the Recycle Bin cannot be opened, edited, or worked on otherwise.
<P>
The intention of the designers is clear: the Recycle Bin is not to be used as a workspace. Instead, it is a last-chance repository. You can <A HREF="../exploring/12.htm#1">put things in the Recycle Bin or take things out</A>--that's all.
<P>
Working with the Recycle Bin under the default settings is covered in section "<A HREF="../files/9.htm#4">Retrieving Files and Folders from the Recycle Bin</A>" later in this chapter. Reconfiguring the Recycle Bin settings is covered in the <A HREF="../exploring/12.htm#1">next chapter</A>.
