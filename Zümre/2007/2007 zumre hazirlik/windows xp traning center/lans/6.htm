<P>
Now that you have all your parts--an NIC (or wireless LAN adapter) for each computer, enough cabling (or none, for a wireless LAN), and a hub (or wireless access point), you're ready to put it all together to create the physical network. This procedure is best done when the computers aren't in use and when you have a good chunk of time to devote to it--on a weekend.

</TABLE></A>
<P>
The first step to installing your network hardware is to install a network interface card (or wireless LAN adapter) in each computer that will be on the network. Turn off each computer, take the cover off, install the NIC, and put the cover on again. For a laptop, this is usually as easy as sliding the card into the PC slot. For a desktop computer, this requires installing the card in a slot on the motherboard according to the manufacturer's installation instructions.
<P>
Once the NIC or wireless LAN adapter is installed, start the computer. Windows should <A HREF="../hardware/index.htm">detect the new hardware and ask you to install the adapter drivers for it</A>.

</TABLE></A>
<P>
For a cabled network, once the NIC and its driver are installed, you can connect the cabling. The computers can be turned on when you connect the cables.
<P>
Cabling can be a simple job or an extravagant one, depending on your needs and how much time, effort, and money you're willing to invest. A home office network that consists of two computers close together probably means cables running on the floor around the edge of the room and behind furniture. Cabling for an office probably means cables hidden by conduit, running inside walls, and running above dropped ceilings. You may want to hire someone if you have many computers to connect and want it done neatly. If you put cable inside ceilings or walls, be sure the installation conforms to fire and electrical codes.
<P>
When planning your wiring job, plan for the future. If you're wiring your office, add extra cables while the walls and ceiling are open. Put network jacks in the walls of any room that you think might have a computer in it some day. Plan your network cabling in the same manner you would plan phone extensions. Doing all the wiring now can make adding a computer to your network much easier in the future.
<P>
Run Category-5 cable from each computer to the hub. The RJ-45 jacks are easy to use--just plug the cable into the NIC and the hub as you would plug a phone wire into a phone jack.
<P>

<TD VALIGN="TOP">Don't run twisted-pair cable in a bundle with electrical power cable because the electromagnetic interference can adversely affect the network--a short-circuit between power and network cables could cause injury or fire.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Once you complete the construction phase, you need to sit at each computer and configure Windows so it knows about the network, as described in the <A HREF="../peer2peer/index.htm">next chapter</A>.

<P>
Finally, put the hub, switch, or wireless access point in a location where it won't be disturbed. For a hub or switch, be sure to label each cable, so that when you are troubleshooting later, you can tell which cable goes to which computer. When you buy your Ethernet cable, you can choose different color cables.
