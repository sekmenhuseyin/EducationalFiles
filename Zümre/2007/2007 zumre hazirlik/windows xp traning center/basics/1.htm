Windows XP is the latest desktop version of Microsoft's Windows series of programs. It's the upgrade to the consumer versions of Windows (95, 98, and Me) as well as to the business, server, and power-user versions (Windows NT and 2000). Windows is an <A NAME="ddoperatingsystem"><I>operating</I> <I>system</I></A>, a program that manages your entire computer system, including its screen, keyboard, disk drives, memory, and central processor. Windows also provides a <A NAME="ddgraphicaluserinterface"><I>graphical user interface</I></A>, or <I>GUI</I>, which enables you to control your computer by using a mouse, <A HREF="../running/1.htm#1">windows</A>, and icons. You can also use the keyboard to give commands; this book describes both methods.

<P>
For years, Microsoft has produced two editions of Windows, one for desktops (that is, for individual users, including for use on laptops) and one for servers (computers that provide services over networks). The desktop versions were Windows 3.1, 95, 98, and Me, and were intended for workstation use--that is, on computers that people used directly. The server versions were Windows NT 4, NT 5, and 2000, and were intended for use on servers (computers that provide services to other computers on a network) as well as by high-end users.
<P>
Windows XP is designed to work for individuals and power users, and comes initially in three versions: Home Edition (for home and small offices), Professional (for offices), and 64-Bit Edition (for technical workstations that use the Intel Itanium CPU). At the end of 2001, Microsoft plans to release two more editions of Windows XP, renamed Windows .NET: Windows .NET Server and Advanced Server (for server machines on small and large networks). This book describes Windows XP Home Edition and Professional, with notes where features are available in one edition and not the other. If you plan to use the Windows .NET Server or Advanced Server versions, refer to <I>Windows .NET Server and Advanced Server: The Complete Reference</I> by Kathy Ivens, (Osborne/McGraw-Hill, 2001). The Microsoft Web site contains details about Windows XP at <A HREF=" http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp"> <B>http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp</B></A>.<B></B>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
You can <A HREF="../wininst/index.htm">upgrade to Windows XP</A> from Windows 98 or Me, or you can do a "clean install" to replace any previous version of Windows on your computer. You can also buy a computer with Windows XP preinstalled. Once Windows XP is installed, you can <A HREF="../running/index.htm">run</A> Windows-compatible <I>application programs</I> (programs for getting real-world work done).
<P>
Windows XP comes bundled with many programs, most of which aren't actually part of the operating system, including Internet connection software (<A HREF="../connecting/index.htm">dial-up connections</A>), an e-mail program (<A HREF="../email/index.htm">Outlook Express</A>), a Web browser (<A HREF="../browsing/index.htm">Internet Explorer</A>), a simple word processing program (<A HREF="../docs/2.htm#1">WordPad</A>), an instant messaging program (<A HREF="../chatting/index.htm">Windows Messenger</A>), <A HREF="../peer2peer/index.htm">local are network support</A>, utilities that help with <A HREF="../disksafe/index.htm">hard-disk housekeeping</A>, and dozens of other programs.

Windows XP requires the following computer hardware:
<UL>
<LI >
A Pentium II, Pentium III, Celeron, compatible, or better CPU running at a speed of at least 300 MHz.
<LI >
At least 64MB of RAM memory (although Microsoft recommends at least 128MB--it's not reliable with only 64MB).
<LI >

A monitor, keyboard, and mouse or other pointing device.
<LI >
If you plan to listen to <A HREF="../audio/1.htm#1">sounds</A> played by Windows and other programs, you need a sound board and speakers attached to your computer. To participate in voice or video chats, you need a microphone or digital video camera, too.
<LI >
If you plan to use your computer to <A HREF="../connecting/index.htm">connect to the Internet</A>, you need a dial-up modem and a regular phone line, an ISDN modem and an ISDN line, a DSL modem and a DSL line, a cable modem and cable connection, or a <A HREF="../lans/index.htm">local area network connection</A>.
