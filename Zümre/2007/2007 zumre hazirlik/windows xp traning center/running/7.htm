<P>
Scheduled Tasks is the program Windows uses to check the files and folders on your hard disk automatically. You can also use the Scheduled Tasks program to run almost any program at a specified time on a regular basis. When you schedule a task, you must specify the following information:
<UL>
<LI >
What program you want to run.
<LI >
How often you want to run it (daily, weekly, monthly, when your computer starts, or when you log on).
<LI >
What time you want the program to start running. For weekly and monthly schedules, you also specify what day to start the program.
<LI >
What user account you want to use when running the program. You enter the user's name and password (usually your own username and password).
</UL>
<P>
When Scheduled Tasks is running, its icon appears in the system tray at the right end of the taskbar.

To tell Scheduled Tasks to run a program on a regular schedule, follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=1>
Look at the Scheduled Tasks window by choosing Start | All Programs | Accessories | System Tools | Scheduled Tasks; or choose Start | Control Panel, click Performance And Maintenance, and click Scheduled Tasks. You see the Scheduled Tasks window, shown in Figure 2-7.

</TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR="#00ffff"><TD><I>Figure 2-7:  The Scheduled Tasks window</I></TD></TR></TABLE>
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=2>
Run the Add Scheduled Task item that appears in the Name column of the Scheduled Tasks window. (If it's underlined, click it once. Otherwise, double-click it.)
<LI  VALUE=3>
Windows runs the Scheduled Task Wizard, which takes you through the steps required to schedule tasks to run automatically. Follow the prompts on the screen, clicking Next to move to the next step.
<LI  VALUE=4>
When the Scheduled Task Wizard displays all the information you have specified about the program's schedule, including the name of the program and when you want it to run, click the Finish button. The program appears on a new line in the Scheduled Tasks window.
</OL>
<P>
Be sure to leave your computer turned on all the time, so when the scheduled time arrives, Windows runs your program. If your computer is off (or Scheduled Tasks isn't running) when the time comes, the program doesn't run.

<P>
If you decide you no longer want Windows to run the program automatically, open the Scheduled Tasks window, right-click the line for the program, and choose Delete from the menu that appears. When Windows asks you to confirm that you want to delete the file for this job, click Yes.
<P>
To cancel running all scheduled programs, choose Advanced | Stop Using Task Scheduler from the menu bar in the Scheduled Tasks window. No scheduled programs will be run until you choose the command Advanced | Start Using Task Scheduler. You can pause the scheduler program by choosing Advanced | Pause Task Scheduler to skip running scheduled programs temporarily and choose Advanced | Continue Task Scheduler to resume. Pausing Scheduled Tasks is a good idea while you are installing new software, for example, so installation isn't interrupted.

You can ask Scheduled Tasks to let you know how its scheduled programs are doing. If you want to be notified when Scheduled Tasks is unable to run a scheduled program, choose Advanced from the Scheduled Tasks window's menu bar and make sure a check mark appears to the left of the Notify Me Of Missed Tasks option (if no check mark appears, choose the option from the menu).
<P>
You can look at a log file of the results of scheduled programs by choosing Advanced | View Log from the Scheduled Tasks menu bar. Windows displays the log file, which is stored in text format in C:\Windows\SchedLgU.txt, using Notepad. Log entries consist of several lines of text, as shown here:
<P><PRE>
"Activation reminder.job" (oobebaln.exe)<BR>
 Finished 7/3/2002 1:39:35 PM<BR>
 Result: The task completed with an exit code of (0).
</PRE>
<P>
The first line describes the program, and the subsequent lines report on the outcome of running the program.
