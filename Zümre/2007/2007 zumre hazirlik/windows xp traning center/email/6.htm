</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
One of the first things people did when personal computers were invented was store lists of addresses on them. It makes sense--the old-fashioned little black book quickly gets filled with scratch-outs as people move, change phone numbers, or get new e-mail addresses, and you always end up wishing you had left a little more space between Sloane and Smith.
<P>
The next good idea in address management was to make the address book into a system utility so that any program could access it. You shouldn't have to keep one list of addresses for your word processor, another for your e-mail program, and a third for your personal information manager. And you shouldn't have to wonder which list has Aunt Gertrude's new address.
<P>
The Windows Address Book is still not the perfect realization of this idea, but it is a definite step in the right direction. Address Book keeps track of almost anything you would want to keep track of; provides a space for notes; and is accessible from <A HREF="../browsing/2.htm#4">Internet Explorer</A>, Outlook Express, and <A HREF="../chatting/2.htm#1">NetMeeting</A>. Unfortunately, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft's e-mail server, has its own address book, so that your addresses may be stored in two separate places.
<P>
You can use the information from the Windows Address Book in <A HREF="../chatting/1.htm#1">Windows Messenger</A>; only available contacts are listed. You may be able to use Address Book from older versions of Outlook, but not Outlook XP.

The window lists the people you have entered into the address book (which the Address Book calls <A NAME="ddcontacts"><I>contacts</I></A>) with the name, e-mail address, and phone numbers for each person. It also lists people who are on your Windows Messenger list and are logged on and available for chat.

</TABLE></A>
<P>
Each user account has its own Address Book, with its own files of contacts. People who use the same user account access the same Address Book, but they can keep their contacts separate by defining different <A NAME="ddidentities"><I>identities</I></A>. You can also use identities to separate your home and work contacts. Only one identity is logged in at any given time. The different identities defined under a single user account share a Shared Contacts folder. Any contact stored in the Shared Contacts folder is available to any of the identities.

You can tell which identity is currently logged in by looking at the title bar of the Address Book window. In Figure 23-4, for example, the Main Identity is logged in. To switch to a different identity, select File | Switch Identity. The Switch Identities dialog box appears, as shown here:
<BR><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="email.adbk2.png" WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=300 ALT="[image]">

</TABLE></A>
<P>
Creating, removing, and otherwise managing identities can only be done by opening Address Book as a stand-alone application (by selecting it from the Start menu, for example). If you open Address Book from another application, such as Outlook Express, the Switch Identity and Manage Identity commands are not included on the File menu.
<P>
When you first start Address Book, one identity appears: the Main Identity. If you want another person to store addresses in your Address Book, create another identity by choosing File | Switch Identity, clicking the Manage Identities button to display the Manage Identities dialog box, and then clicking the New button.
<P>
To remove an identity, open the Manage Identities dialog box as before, select the identity from the list, and click Remove.
<P>
To see the entries in an identity's part of the Address Book, click that identity in the list at the left side of the Address Book window.

<P>
If you don't want the other users of your computer to access the information in your Address Book, you can secure your identity with a password. However, you should realize that the protection this provides is mainly symbolic, like putting a Keep Out sign on an unlocked door. Establishing a password prevents other people from logging in as you, but they can still examine and even change the information in your contact files by selecting File | Show All Contents.

To establish a password for your identity, choose File | Switch Identity, and then click the Manage Identities button in the Switch Identities dialog box.

Choose a password and type it in the Password and Confirm Password lines of the Enter Password dialog box. Click OK or Close in all the open dialog boxes.
<P>
To change the password on your identity, follow the same instructions as in the previous paragraph until you see the Identity Properties dialog box. Click the Change Password button.

You can get information into Address Book in three ways: importing information from your current address book program (described in the section "<A HREF="../email/4.htm#5">Importing Addresses from Other Mail Programs</A>" earlier in this chapter), importing virtual business cards that have arrived by e-mail, capturing information automatically from Outlook Express, or entering information by hand. Once you have a list of contacts in your Address Book, you can organize them into groups. To see the entries in your address book, click the Main Identity's Contacts entry on the left side of the Address Book window. The entries appear on the right side of the Address Book window.

To add more information to an existing contact listing, choose the contact from the contact list and click the Properties button. Enter the new information on the appropriate line and tab of the contact Properties box. Notice the Properties box displays a Summary tab that you didn't see when you were entering a new contact. This tab is just for reference; each piece of information on this tab can be edited on some other tab. Any Web page listed on the Summary tab has a Go button next to it; clicking this button opens your Web browser and displays the Web page.

Address Book enables you to keep track of several e-mail addresses for a single person, with one of them specified as the default. To add a new e-mail address, type it into the E-Mail Addresses box on the Name tab of the contact Properties box. Then click the Add button. The new e-mail address appears in the list just below the E-Mail Addresses box.

Having your customers, your coworkers, and your child's piano teacher all on one big alphabetical list can be confusing.

<LI  VALUE=6>
If you want to add new members to the group, click Select Members again. If you want to remove names from the list, select the names in from the Group Members list in the Properties dialog box and click Remove. If you want to add people who aren't already in your Address Book, type the name and address into the Name and E-Mail boxes at the bottom of the dialog box, and then click the Add button. (Names that you add in this way will not be added to your contacts list as individuals, but only as part of the group.)

Address Book offers you the same choice of views that Windows Explorer does: Large Icon, Small Icon, List, and Details. Choose among them on the View menu. The differences among Large Icon, Small Icon, and List are fairly trivial: Large Icon uses a large index card icon and lists contacts in rows, Small Icon uses a small index icon and lists contacts in rows, and List uses a small index card icon and lists contacts in columns. Details view uses small icons and presents the name, e-mail address, home phone number, and business phone number of each contact in four columns.

In Details view, you can list contacts according to name, e-mail address, home phone number, or business phone number. As in the Details view in Windows Explorer, click the head of any column to list contacts according to that column in ascending order.
