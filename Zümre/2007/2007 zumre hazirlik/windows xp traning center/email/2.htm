</TABLE></A>
<P>
Oversimplifying somewhat, the process works like this:
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=1>
Using an e-mail program, such as Outlook Express, the sender creates a message and decides who the recipients should be.
<LI  VALUE=2>
At a designated place at the beginning of the message, the sender lists the e-mail addresses of all the recipients. (The sender can specify a long list of recipients, but for simplicity, we'll pretend there is only one.) An <A NAME="ddemailaddress"><I>e-mail address</I></A> specifies two things: a computer on the Internet on which a recipient receives mail (called an <A NAME="ddincomingmailserver"><I>incoming mail server</I></A>), and the name that the incoming mail server uses to designate the mailbox of the recipient. So, for example, the e-mail address <B>president@whitehouse.gov</B> specifies the incoming mail server whitehouse.gov and a mailbox on whitehouse.gov called president.
<LI  VALUE=3>
The sender connects to an <A NAME="ddoutgoingmailserver"><I>outgoing mail server</I></A>, a computer connected to the Internet (usually a computer owned by the sender's Internet service provider) that runs a mail-handling program that supports <A NAME="ddsmtp"><I>SMTP</I></A> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), which is used for Internet mail). These servers are usually called <A NAME="ddsmtpservers"><I>SMTP servers</I></A>. The message is sent from the sender's computer to the outgoing mail server.
<LI  VALUE=4>
From the outgoing mail server, the message is passed across the Internet to the recipient's incoming mail server.
<LI  VALUE=5>
The recipient's incoming mail server files the message in the recipient's <A NAME="ddmailbox"><I>mailbox</I></A>, a file or folder containing all the messages that the recipient hasn't downloaded to her own computer yet.
<LI  VALUE=6>
Using an e-mail program (which need not be the same as the one the sender used to create and send the message), the recipient looks for new mail by logging in to the incoming mail server. Incoming mail servers use one of three protocols for receiving mail: <A NAME="ddpostofficeprotocol3"><I>Post Office Protocol 3</I></A> (abbreviated <A NAME="ddpop3"><I>POP3</I></A> or <A NAME="ddpop"><I>POP</I></A>) , <A NAME="ddinternetmessageaccessprotocol"><I>Internet Message Access Protocol</I></A> (<A NAME="ddimap"><I>IMAP</I></A>), or <I>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</I> (<I>HTTP</I>). The incoming mail server uses POP, IMAP, or HTTP to deliver the message to the recipient's computer, along with any other messages that may have arrived since the recipient last checked for mail.
<LI  VALUE=7>
The recipient uses the e-mail program to read the message.
</OL>
<P>
Every e-mail message consists of a <A NAME="ddheader"><I>header</I></A> (lines containing the address, the return address, the date, and other information about the message) and a <A NAME="ddbody"><I>body</I></A> (the text of the message).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/tip.png" ALT="tip" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=29></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">To send messages right away to people who are logged in at the same time you are, and receive answers in seconds, use an <A HREF="../chatting/1.htm#1">instant messaging</A> program like Windows Messenger.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3><B>What Is Hotmail?</B></FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
Hotmail (at <A HREF="http://www.hotmail.com"><B>http://www.hotmail.com</B></A>) is a Web-based e-mail account that you access by visiting a Web site with your Web browser, rather than with the e-mail program installed on your computer. A notable exception is that Microsoft has set up Outlook Express to work conveniently with its Web e-mail service Hotmail. After you identify yourself by giving a user name and a password, the Hotmail Web site shows you your messages and allows you to send e-mail to other people. You can access a Hotmail account through a Web browser or through Outlook Express.
<P>
Many other free Web-based accounts are available: the most popular is Yahoo Mail, at <A HREF="http://mail.yahoo.com"><B>http://mail.yahoo.com</B></A>. In general, Hotmail is as good as any other Web-based e-mail service, and has the advantage that Outlook Express supports it. Using Hotmail together with Outlook Express can help you avoid many of the usual aggravations of Web-based e-mail, because your e-mail interface resides on your own computer rather than on a Web site. You can conveniently work with your downloaded mail when you are offline. However, when you are away from your usual computer, you can work with your e-mail through a Web browser and leave the messages on the Hotmail computer.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3><B>What Are Attached Files?</B></FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
Sometimes when you write e-mail you want to send more than just a message; you want to send files that the recipient can use with an application on her computer. For example, if you are working on a Word document with someone, you don't just want to talk about the document in your e-mail, you want to send revised versions of the document back and forth. <A NAME="ddattachedfiles"><I>Attached files</I></A> (or <A NAME="ddattachments"><I>attachments</I></A> for short) are files that you send along with an e-mail message. The recipient can save the files on their own computer system and/or use them with their own applications. See "<A HREF="../email/5.htm#15">Attaching a File to a Message</A>" later in this chapter for how to attach files to e-mail messages.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3><B>How Do E-Mail Viruses Work?</B></FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
E-mail viruses are computer viruses--rogue programs that hackers write to do mischief on other people's computers--that spread by e-mailing copies of themselves to other computers. (Technically, such programs are <I>worms</I>, not viruses, but the popular press does not usually make this distinction.) If an e-mail virus gets into your computer, it may try to send infected e-mail to everyone in your Address Book. The e-mail sent will look like it is coming from you--which won't make you popular with the people in your Address Book.
<P>
The most common (but not the only) way for e-mail viruses to spread is through file attachments, especially attachments that are executable (.exe) files or that invoke powerful applications like Visual Basic. The text of the message is a lure to get you to open the attachment. (Remember: the message comes to you from someone who has you in his address book. So it looks like your good friend Bob has sent you a mysterious attachment with a message saying something like "Try this. It's fun.") Once you open the attachment, your computer is infected.
<P>
Outlook Express is vulnerable to viruses, both because it is widely used and because it can automatically run programs that arrive attached to e-mail messages. However, you can decrease your risk of getting e-mail viruses: see the section "<A HREF="../email/2.htm#4">Protecting Yourself From E-Mail Viruses</A>" later in this chapter. For more about viruses in general and what you can do to protect your system, see the section "<A HREF="../security/1.htm#1">Protecting Your System from Viruses and Worms</A>" in Chapter 31.
