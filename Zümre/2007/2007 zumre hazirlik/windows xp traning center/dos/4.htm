<P>
Windows provides a long list of settings for customizing the environment for the Command Prompt window or for a DOS program. Nearly all the settings are parameters you can tweak to help a recalcitrant DOS program run in the Windows environment. More often than not, adjusting these settings won't be necessary.
<P>
Earlier versions of Windows put the settings for DOS programs into separate <A NAME="ddpiffiles"><I>PIF files</I></A> (program information files), and some programs still use them. Windows XP stores the settings in DOS initialization files, in Command Prompt properties, and in program properties.

</TABLE></A>
<P>
Windows XP enables you to create a Config file to load drivers and an Autoexec file to run DOS commands before the program runs. Windows XP provides default versions of these DOS initialization files, called Config.nt and Autoexec.nt, which are located in the C:\Windows\System32 folder (assuming that Windows is installed in C:\Windows).
<P>
The Config file contains DOS VM configuration commands, as well as commands to load real-mode device drivers. Autoexec contains regular DOS commands to be run as soon as DOS has finished starting up. Although any DOS command is valid, the only command commonly used is SET, which defines environment variables used by some programs and drivers. Config.nt is read during the DOS startup process. Windows runs the commands from Autoexec.nt after processing Config.nt. These files can now be located anywhere, which improves DOS backward compatibility by allowing you to have several different versions of the files and selecting the one that best suits the program you want to run.
<P>
The Autoexec and Config files are text files, which you can edit with Notepad. Microsoft recommends that you leave the original Config.nt and Autoexec.nt unchanged, and create edited copies with other names, like Config.games and Autoexec.pcfile, for your various applications. See "<A HREF="../dos/5.htm#1">Installing and Configuring DOS Programs</A>" later in this chapter for how to create your own versions of the files for the DOS program you want to configure.

When a Command Prompt window is open, you can see and set its settings by clicking the System Menu button in its upper-left corner and choosing Properties. The settings on the various tabs of the <A HREF="../dos/4.htm#1">Command Prompt Properties dialog box</A>, shown in Figure 39-2, control the appearance and some operational aspects of a DOS program.

The Window Size setting controls the actual size of the widow on the screen. If the Screen Buffer Size is larger than the Windows Size (the default is for it to be several times taller, but the same width), you can scroll up and down the buffer using the window's scrollbars.

Additional options for DOS programs are set in the program's Properties dialog box. To set them, find either the executable (.exe or .com) file for the program or a shortcut to the executable file (you may need to choose Start | Search to find it). Many DOS applications, especially games, come with more than one executable file. Along with the executable file that runs the program, other executable files may uninstall or configure the program. Once you've located the executable file that runs the program (or a shortcut to it), right-click the file or shortcut and choose Properties to see its Properties dialog box. Figure 39-6 shows the Memory tab of the dialog box.

<P>
The Memory tab of the program's Properties dialog box (shown in Figure 39-6) controls how much memory is available to a program using each of the DOS addressing schemes. In nearly all cases, Windows automatically allocates an appropriate amount of each kind of memory to the program when it runs the program. A few programs fail if given as much memory as Windows makes available (at the time many DOS programs were written, most people never imagined that anyone would ever put as much as 4MB in a single PC). If this is a problem, determine the kind of memory that the program uses--expanded (EMS), extended (XMS), or MS-DOS Protected-Mode (DPMI)--and try limiting it to 8,192KB (the program's documentation or help files may specify what types of memory the program can use and the maximum amount of memory that the program can handle).

New to Windows XP is the <A HREF="../running/8.htm#1">compatibility mode</A>, which attempts to present an environment for software that expects to be run in a particular version of Windows. For example, Ignition (the classic racing game from Unique Development Studios) refuses to install on Windows XP without the Windows 95 compatibility mode.

Applications written specifically for Windows XP use something called a <A NAME="ddmanifest"><I>manifest</I></A> to work with the Luna (Windows XP) theme. A manifest is a file that describes how the application is to appear while using the Luna interface. Most recent applications that comply closely with the Win32 API (Application Programming Interface--a set of tools that define how applications work with Windows) typically work fine without a manifest, but some do not. If an application behaves unexpectedly or does not appear correctly, try selecting the Disable Visual Themes check box on the Compatibility tab of the Properties dialog box for the program. For example, Macromedia's Dreamweaver 4.0 Web site authoring program has custom toolbars that do not work well with Luna (some buttons are covered by the swoopy new interface).
