Once you have used the New Connection Wizard to create a network connection, you can change its settings, copy it, rename it, or delete it. You can also choose which network connection is the default for connecting to the Internet.

<TD VALIGN="TOP">Previous versions of Windows didn't come with <A HREF="../connecting/0.htm#1">TCP/IP</A> (the communications protocol used on the Internet) pre-installed. Instead, you chose it from a list of popular network protocols. Windows XP comes with TCP/IP installed, and you can't uninstall it. (It's unlikely that you'd want to do so, since TCP/IP is used for both the Internet and LANs!)

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
To configure a network connection or to change an existing connection's configuration, open the <A HREF="../connecting/2.htm#1">Network Connections window</A> by choosing Start | Connect To | Show All Connections (if Connect To appears on the Start menu), choosing Start | Network Connections (if Network Connections appears on the Start menu), clicking View Network Connections from the Task pane of the My Network Places window, or choosing Start | Control Panel | Network And Internet Connections | Network Connections. Right-click the icon for the connection and choose Properties from the menu that appears, or select the connection icon and choose File | Properties. Either way, you see the Properties dialog box for the network connection. Different types of connections display different properties dialog boxes. Figure 22-4 shows one for a dial-up connection, and Table 22-1 lists dial-up connection properties. For the properties of LAN connections (including DSL and cable Internet connections), see section "<A HREF="../peer2peer/3.htm#1">Installing and Configuring Network Components</A>" in Chapter28.

<P>
For a connection to an Internet account, you may also need to configure the TCP/IP protocol. On the Properties dialog box for the connection, click the Networking tab, select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) in the list of components, and then click the Properties button.

<P>
When your computer is connected to the Internet using TCP/IP, it has its own <A NAME="ddipaddress"><I>IP address</I></A> (<I>IP</I> is the acronym for Internet Protocol). An IP address is in the form of <I>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</I>, where each <I>xxx</I> is a number from 0 to 255. (That is, an IP address consists of four eight-bit numbers.) An example of an IP address might be 204.71.16.253.
<P>
In addition to IP addresses, computers on the Internet have <A NAME="dddomainnames"><I>domain names</I></A>, alphanumeric names like <B>www.microsoft.com</B> or <B>net.gurus.com</B>. A <A NAME="dddomainnameserver"><I>domain name server</I></A> or <A NAME="dddns"><I>DNS</I></A> is a computer on the Internet that translates between domain names and numeric IP addresses. Your ISP usually provides two DNS servers (one is in case the other one breaks down).
<P>
On the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, make these entries:
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Your IP address</B>  Ten years ago, when you signed up for an Internet account, your ISP assigned you a <A HREF="../peer2peer/1.htm#3">static IP address</A>--an IP address that never changed. Now, almost all ISPs assign you a temporary IP address when you connect, so choose Obtain An IP Address Automatically unless your ISP has given you a static IP address (unlikely).
<LI >
<B>DNS Server Address</B>  Until a few years ago, you needed to choose Use The Following DNS Server Addresses and type the addresses in. Now most ISPs can tell Windows the DNS addresses when you connect, so choose Obtain DNS Server Address Automatically unless your ISP tells you otherwise.

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
Windows tries to log on to your dial-up account automatically. Most accounts follow a standard series of steps: they transmit your user name and your account' password, and then receive confirmation that you are logged in so that communications can begin.
<P>
If your account uses a nonstandard dialog box for logging in, Windows can't log in automatically. You can automate logging in by creating a <A NAME="ddlogonscript"><I>logon script</I></A>, a text file containing a small program that tells Windows what prompts to wait for and what to type in response. For example, if your ISP's computer uses a nonstandard prompt to ask for your password, or requires you to type a command to begin a PPP session, you can write a script to log on for you. If your ISP uses the standard series of transmissions, you don't need a logon script. Logon scripts have the file extension .scp.
<P>
To use a logon script, follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=1>
Log on manually, making notes about which prompts you see and what you must type in response to those prompts. To log in manually, you can use your network connection with a <A NAME="ddterminalwindow"><I>terminal window</I></A>, which enables you to see the session and type commands to your ISP. To tell Windows to open a terminal window while connecting, click the Security tab of the Properties dialog box for the connection and select the Show Terminal Window check box. Another way to log in manually is by using <A HREF="../winsock/1.htm#1">HyperTerminal</A> to connect to your ISP.
<LI  VALUE=2>
Create a logon script by using a text editor, such as <A HREF="../docs/1.htm#1">Notepad</A>. Windows comes with a short manual about writing logon scripts in the file C:\Windows\Script.doc. (This file, and the scripting language you use in logon scripts, have remained unchanged since Windows 95.)
<LI  VALUE=3>
Tell Windows about the logon script by selecting the Run Script check box on the Security tab of the Properties dialog box for the connection and typing the filename in the box to its right.
<LI  VALUE=4>
Test the script, editing it with your text editor and viewing the results in a terminal window.
<LI  VALUE=5>
You can deselect the Show Terminal Windows check box when your script works, if you are tired of seeing the terminal window each time you connect.

You might think all the properties of a dial-up connection would appear on the connection's Properties dialog box (shown earlier in the chapter in Figure 22-4), but they don't. Most of the settings on the (ill-named) Internet Properties dialog box pertain to your Web browser, rather than to your Internet connection, but a few additional settings appear on its Connections tab. (This dialog box is called Internet Options when you display it by choosing Tools | Internet Options from Internet Explorer.)
<P>
To display the Internet Properties dialog box, choose Start | Control Panel | Network And Internet Connections and run the Internet Options program. Figure 22-6 shows the Connections tab of the Internet Properties (or Internet Options) dialog box. The other tabs of this dialog box apply to using a Web browser, and are covered in <A HREF="../browsing/index.htm">Chapter24</A>.

Callbacks ensure that you are who you say you are (or at least that you are at the phone number that you're supposed to be at). If an Internet host offers to call you back, Windows usually displays a dialog box that asks whether you want to do so, but you can configure how Windows responds to the offer.
