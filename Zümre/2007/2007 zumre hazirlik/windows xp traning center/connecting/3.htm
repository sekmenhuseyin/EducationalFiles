We recommend that you choose an ISP by talking to people you know and determining which ISP your friends and coworkers are most satisfied with. However, you can also use the New Connection Wizard to look for ISPs with phone numbers in your area or sign up for an MSN account. Whether you have already chosen an ISP or want use the Microsoft Internet Referral Service to select an ISP, you start by running the New Connection Wizard.

The New Connection Wizard starts automatically when you run an Internet application (such as Internet Explorer or Outlook Express) with no Internet connection configured. You can also start the New Connection Wizard by clicking Create A New Connection in the Task pane of the Network Connections window, or by choosing Start | All Programs | Accessories | Communications | New Connection Wizard. The New Connection Wizard gives you four choices (shown in Figure 22-3:

<TD VALIGN="TOP">Previous versions of Windows came with the Internet Connection Wizard, which has been replaced with the New Connection Wizard. If the Internet Connection Wizard is still lurking on your system (for example, if you upgraded from Windows Me/9x), close this Wizard if it runs, and use the New Connection Wizard instead. The only time we find the Internet Connection Wizard useful is when Outlook Express runs it to set up your e-mail account.

Follow the instructions in the previous section to run the New Connection Wizard. Make these choices, click Next after each:

<B>Network Connection Type  </B>Click Connect To The Internet.
<LI >
<B>Getting Ready  </B>Click Choose From A List Of Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

<B>Completing The New Connection Wizard  </B>Click Select From A List Of Other ISPs. The Wizard dials a toll-free number (if you are in the United States) to connect to the Microsoft Internet Referral Service.

<P>
After a delay, you see a window that lists its suggested ISPs and online services. You can read about each ISP or online service by clicking its name. If you want to sign up for an account with one of these ISPs, click Next. Otherwise, click Cancel.

<TD VALIGN="TOP">Microsoft's list of ISPs includes only a few of the large national ones, but no local ISPs. In fact, Microsoft may choose to make a deal with one or two big ISPs and recommend only those ISPs to everyone. The ISPs listed don't necessarily have local numbers in your area, even though you told Microsoft your area code and exchange. Before you choose an ISP, look for ads in the business section of your local newspaper to see what local ISPs are available. A small, local ISP usually gives better service and support than a large one, along with having a better selection of local numbers. If you travel frequently with a laptop, consider a national ISP, or stick with a small, local ISP and use a national ISP when you're on the road.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
If you choose to create a new account by using one of the ISPs listed by Microsoft, the Wizard asks you to provide information about yourself, including a credit card to which you want to charge your account. The sign-up procedure varies by ISP. During the sign-up, be sure to write down all the information the sign-up program displays, including technical support phone numbers, account numbers, and passwords.

<TD VALIGN="TOP">Before using your account, find out whether the number your modem will be dialing to connect to the account is a local call for you. If not, you should probably cancel the account, because the long distance charges for using the account will be many times more than the cost of the account itself. Instead, find a local ISP with a local phone number and <A HREF="../connecting/2.htm#1">configure a network connection</A> for the account.
