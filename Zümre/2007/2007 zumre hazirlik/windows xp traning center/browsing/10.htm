You should keep two risk factors in mind when you use the Web:
<UL>
<LI >
Web sites may be collecting information about you and your browsing habits using small files called <I>cookies</I> that are stored on your computer.
<LI >
The scripts and applets that allow Web sites to offer more complex content and services may also make your computer more vulnerable to viruses or hackers.
</UL>
<P>
This section discusses the tools and options that Internet Explorer provides for dealing with these risks. Also see the section "<A HREF="../security/2.htm#1">Managing Which Files Internet Explorer Downloads</A>" in Chapter 31.

<P>
Internet Explorer 6 gives you much more control over cookies than previous versions of Internet Explorer did. Unfortunately, IE 6's privacy level settings make the situation seem much more complicated than it is, and none of them is a very good cookie policy. However, you can override Internet Explorer's automatic cookie-handling system to set up a simple, sensible cookie policy.
<P>
The next few sections explain what cookies are and how the P3P privacy protection system works. If you don't care about that and just want to know what to do, skip ahead to the "<A HREF="../browsing/10.htm#7">Setting Cookie Policy</A>" section.

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
A <A NAME="ddcookie"><I>cookie</I></A> is a small (at most 4K) file that a Web server can store on your machine. Its purpose is to allow a Web server to personalize a Web page, depending on whether you have been to that Web site before and what you may have told it during previous sessions. For example, when you establish an account with an online retailer or subscribe to an online magazine, you may be asked to fill out a form that includes some information about yourself and your preferences. The Web server may store that information (along with information about when you visit the site) in a cookie on your machine. When you return to that Web site in the future, the retailer's Web server can read its cookie, recall this information, and structure its Web pages accordingly.
<P>
Much has been written about whether cookies create a security or privacy hazard for you. If your Web browser is working properly, the security hazard is minimal. It is, at first glance, unsettling to think that Web servers are storing information on your hard drive without your knowledge. But cookies are not executable programs. They cannot, for example, search for and accumulate information from elsewhere on your system. They simply record information that you have already given to the Web server.
<P>
The privacy issue is real, however. Cookies do make it easier for advertising companies to gather information about your browsing habits. For example, a company that advertises on a large number of Web sites can use cookies to keep track of where you have seen its ads before, and which ads (if any) you clicked. In this way advertisers can learn your interests and perhaps deduce more about you than you would want them to know.
<P>
Cookies are of two basic kinds: first-party cookies and third-party cookies. (You are considered to be the second party.) The difference is in where they come from. First-party cookies are cookies that come directly from the Web site you asked for. For example, if you register with Yahoo and personalize a Yahoo start page, the cookie that Yahoo sets is a first-party cookie. Third-party cookies are cookies that come from Web servers that you may not realize you are dealing with. For example, the Yahoo start page may contain advertising placed by an agency like DoubleClick, and the cookie that the advertising agency sets is a third-party cookie.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3><B>What Is P3P?</B></FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) is a new open standard (which Internet Explorer 6 supports) for Web sites to specify their privacy policies in a form that can be read by computers. The idea is that you can decide once and for all how high to set your privacy standards, and your Web browser can compare your decisions to the privacy policies of the Web sites you visit, warning you if your standards are about to be violated.
<P>
Here's how it works: The people who create Web sites fill out a multiple-choice form about what information their Web site collects, what it does with that information, and how long it keeps the information. Their answers get codified into tags that get attached to their Web pages-tags that browsers like IE 6 can read but typically don't display. You set one of five privacy levels that IE 6 offers, and it blocks cookies and issues privacy warnings accordingly.
<P>
The benefit of the system is that the multiple-choice questions at least pin down the Web sites. Up until now, most Web sites either have not had privacy policies or have written them in impenetrable legalese. It has been completely impractical to read the privacy policies of all the Web sites you visit and make individual judgments about them.
<P>
The system has several weaknesses, however, and at the moment it is unclear whether it will do any good. First, it's voluntary--Web sites don't have to fill out the questionnaire, and if very few do, the system will be useless. (This is what happened to the PICS system for rating the sex-and-violence content of Web sites. See "<A HREF="../browsing/9.htm#3">Blocking Offensive Web Content</A>" earlier in this chapter.) Second, it's nobody's job to verify that the Web sites have answered the questions honestly. Finally, you have to count on the browser makers to implement P3P in a way that lets you do what you want to do in a simple, understandable fashion. Since Microsoft is a major player in e-commerce and Web advertising, its sympathies are at least as much with the advertisers as with you, and they have designed Internet Explorer 6 accordingly.

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
The privacy tab of the Internet Options dialog box contains a slider that you can set to one of six levels from Accept All Cookies to Block All Cookies. The default level is Medium. The descriptions of these levels are phrased using technical terms like <I>personally identifiable information</I>, <I>implicit consent</I>, <I>explicit consent</I>, and <I>compact privacy policy</I>. What follows is our interpretation of what these levels actually mean.
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Block All Cookies  </B>At this level you are unable to log in to access Hotmail, or a Yahoo home page, or to use a subscription to the online <I>Wall Street Journal</I>. You could make this setting liveable if you could create exceptions for your favorite Web sites, but Microsoft has disabled the exception-making capability for this setting.
<LI >
<B>High  </B>Cookies are only accepted from Web sites that offer P3P information, and then only if that information says that they don't make keep track of information that would identify you personally (like your name, for example, or your phone number) unless you've explicitly given them permission to do so. At this level we could log into Hotmail and Yahoo, but not <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>.
<LI >
<B>Medium High  </B>Same as High, except that first-party cookies are accepted from Web sites that use personally identifiable information without your explicit consent, if they somehow allow you to opt out of this usage. (In general, we don't like opt-out processes. They require too much alertness and diligence on your part.) At this level we could see <I>The Wall Street Journal.</I>
<LI >
<B>Medium  </B>Allows third-party cookies that let you opt out of their use of personally identifiable information. Restricts first-party cookies that use personally identifiable information without letting you opt out. (We have no idea what the difference between "restrict" and "block" is.)
<LI >
<B>Low  </B>Accepts all first-party cookies. Restricts third-party cookies from Web sites that don't offer P3P information or that don't let you opt out of their use of personally identifiable information.
<LI >
<B>Accept All Cookies  </B>Accepts all cookies without asking you.<B></B>

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
First we'll tell you what you don't want: You don't want to block all cookies, because you give up much of the functionality and convenience of the Web. You also don't want Internet Explorer to ask you what to do every time a Web site wants to set a cookie, because you'll spend more time deciding about cookies than you'll spend reading Web pages.
<P>
You <I>do </I>want to make a distinction between first-party and third-party cookies, because third-party cookies benefit only the advertisers, not you.
<P>
The cookie policy we'd like to have is Medium High for first-party cookies, and block third-party cookies altogether. This does not seem to be possible with Internet Explorer. Given that fact, we recommend the following policy: accept all first-party cookies and block all third-party cookies. This isn't one of the six levels on the slider, but you can configure Internet Explorer to do it.
<P>
Another reasonable option (but somewhat more difficult to set up) is to select the High level and then create exceptions for a few favorite Web sites whose cookies are blocked. This policy allows a few more third-party cookies and a few less first-party cookies than the policy suggested in the previous paragraph. However, this option stops many shopping sites from working, because the sites use shopping-cart programs hosted on third-party Web sites. (Another options is to use Netscape instead of IE, because of its more flexible cookie policies.)

<P>
Some Web pages increase the amount of interactivity they can offer by downloading small programs to run on your computer. For example, rather than transmitting the individual frames of an animation over the Internet, a Web server may send an animation-constructing program that runs on your computer. A financial Web site may download a program that displays a scrolling stock ticker. Typically, this process is invisible to the user--the interaction or the animation just happens, without calling your attention to how it happens.
<P>
While these programs are useful, they also create security issues. If Web sites can put useful programs on your computer and run them without informing you, precautions must be taken to make sure that they can't also put harmful programs on your computer. Internet Explorer takes certain precautions automatically and allows you the option to choose additional precautions.

<P>
We have never been big fans of <A HREF="../browsing/10.htm#10">ActiveX controls</A>. They allow Web sites to have too much power over your system and are hard to monitor. If you should happen to download and install a rogue ActiveX control by mistake, it could (on its own) download and install lots more rogue ActiveX controls--which would then be permanent parts of your software environment, even when you are offline. None of this would appear the least bit suspicious to any virus-detecting software you might own, because ActiveX controls aren't viruses: They have the same status as applications that you install yourself.
<P>
Disabling ActiveX controls is one option. However, if you frequent Microsoft Web sites like MSN or MSNBC, you will be exposed to numerous temptations to turn them back on. (We finally gave in to the excellent portfolio-tracking services at MSN Moneycentral.) We suggest the following compromise: Disable ActiveX controls everywhere but in the Trusted Sites security zone. (Do this from the Security Settings dialog box, following the steps in the "Security Zones" section above.) When you find a Microsoft Web site that offers some wonderful service involving ActiveX controls, move that site into the Trusted Sites security zone. See Chapter 31 for a <A HREF="../security/index.htm">discussion of security zones and trusted sites</A>.
<P>
ActiveX controls are stored in the folder C:\Windows\Downloaded Program Files. If you use Internet Explorer, you should check this file periodically to see what applications Internet Explorer has downloaded. Dispose of an ActiveX control by right-clicking its icon and selecting Remove from the shortcut menu.

New for Internet Explorer 6, the Privacy Report helps you determine how much information you are willing to give a particular site. It also enables you to determine what kind of information a site is storing on your computer and whether the site complies with its own privacy policy.
<P>
The primary drawback here is that Microsoft has aligned itself with TRUSTe (at <A HREF="http://www.truste.org"><B>http://www.truste.org</B></A>), a self-proclaimed privacy watchdog group. However, TRUSTe predominantly sells their services as a site evaluator, only requiring sites to post a <A NAME="ddprivacypolicy"><I>privacy policy</I></A>. Posting a policy, no matter how good it looks, is no guarantee that it will be adhered to. Only trust those you know you can trust, and don't leave the trusting up to a third party.
<P>
Accessing the Windows Privacy Report is easy. In Internet Explorer, choose View | Privacy Report from the menu. You see a list of the objects that are loaded on the page you are looking at, typically graphics, like this:
