<P>
Running the Network Setup Wizard is usually all you need to do to set up a workgroup network or attach your PC to an existing workgroup. However, if you are connecting to a domain-based or other type of network, you may need to install, configure, or uninstall network components yourself. Talk to your LAN administrator before making any changes to your configuration.
<P>
For each networking connection listed in the Network Connections window, you can see its properties by right-clicking the connection and choosing Properties from the menu that appears. Figure 28-5 shows the properties of a LAN connection.

<P>
The Local Area Connection Properties dialog box lists the network interface card that connects your computer to the LAN. It also lists the <A HREF="../peer2peer/1.htm#1">clients, protocols, and services</A> used for this network connection. The network interface card appears at the top, in the Connect Using box. The clients, protocols, and services are listed in the This Connection Uses the Following Items box, with icons that identify the different types of components:
<BR><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="peer2peer.icons.png" WIDTH=190 HEIGHT=548 ALT="[image]">
<P>
For a standard TCP/IP LAN, these four components should be installed (they should appear in your Local Area Connection Properties dialog box) and enabled (each check box contains a check mark):
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Client For Microsoft Networks</B>  Client that enables the computer to communicate with other Windows computers.
<LI >
<B>File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft Networks</B>  Service that shares files and printers. This service should be enabled only on a LAN connection, not on an Internet connection.
<LI >
<B>QoS Packet Scheduler  </B>Service that determines the precedence of information packets on the LAN based on Quality of Service (QoS) standards.<B></B>
<LI >
<B>Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</B>  Protocol used on the Internet and many LANs.<B></B>
</UL>
<P>
 If you have these four components and your LAN uses TCP/IP, you probably don't need to install any network components. Skip down to the section "<A HREF="../peer2peer/4.htm#1">Checking Your Network Connection</A>" later in this chapter.

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
Chapter 13 described how to install a network interface adapter if your computer doesn't already have one. The <A NAME="ddadapter"><I>adapter</I></A> is the software driver that allows your PC to communicate with the network interface card in your PC. (Network interface cards are also called <I>network adapters</I>.) Every model of network interface card has its own driver, which must be installed so the client software knows how to package information and send it to the network interface card.
<P>
Your network adapter appears in the Connect Using box of the Local Area Connection Properties dialog box (Figure 28-5). Click the Configure button to see the <A HREF="../hardware/4.htm#28">Properties dialog box</A> for the network interface card.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=3><B>Installing a Client</B></FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
The next step is to install the client component, which identifies the type of network on which your computer will be. When you configure your network connection (or when Windows finds your Plug and Play network interface card), Windows also installs the Client For Microsoft Networks. If a client is installed, it appears in the This Connection Uses The Following Items dialog box in the Local Area Connection Properties dialog box (Figure 28-5).
<P>
Because you are installing a peer-to-peer Windows network, the Client For Microsoft Networks is the one you need. (It is similar to the Workstation service that came with Windows NT 4.0 Workstation.) If you mistakenly deleted your Client For Microsoft Networks, or if you need the Client Service For NetWare (which also comes with Windows XP), follow these steps:

When you install Windows, it automatically installs the TCP/IP protocol, in case you want to use TCP/IP for Internet communication. We recommend that you use TCP/IP if you are setting up a new network, since it's the standard.

<P>
Starting with Windows XP, Microsoft no longer supports NetBEUI. If you use NetBEUI for a small network, you have two choices: Install NetBEUI from the Windows XP CD-ROM, even though Microsoft no longer supports it, or upgrade all the computers on your LAN to TCP/IP. Windows XP also comes with support for NetWare's IPX/SPX protocol, which you can easily install as a network component.

<P>
When you install a protocol, Windows "binds" the new protocol to all the clients and services you have available--usually File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft Networks and Client For Microsoft Networks. A <A NAME="ddbinding"><I>binding</I></A> tells Windows to use a specific protocol with a specific client or service.
<P>
You might not want to use all of your installed protocols to work with all your installed clients and services. You can control which protocols work with which clients and services, and which protocol Windows should try first, by opening the Network Connections window (choose Start | Control Panel, click Network And Internet Connections, and click Network Connections) and choosing Advanced | Advanced Settings. You see the Advanced Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 28-7. Click the Local Area Connection in the Connections box (if it's not already selected). The lower part of the Adapters And Bindings tab shows your client and services for that connection, with your installed protocols listed under each client or service.

<TD VALIGN="TOP">If you connect to the Internet through a hub or router than doesn't provide a firewall between your computers and the Internet, don't use TCP/IP for your file and printer sharing. Instead, on each computer on your LAN, install the IPX/SPX protocol, as described in "Installing a Protocol" earlier in this chapter. Then use the Advanced Settings dialog box on each computer to disable Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft Networks. Leave IPX/SPX enabled, so that all the computers can use that protocol for file and printer sharing. Leave TCP/IP installed for use by your Internet connection.
