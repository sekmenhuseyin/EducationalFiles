Windows XP comes in various versions: Windows XP Home Edition (for home and small-office users), Windows XP Professional (for corporate workstations), Windows XP 64-Bit Edition (for Itanium-based workstations), Windows .NET Server (for network servers), and Windows .NET Advanced Server (for network servers that need advanced features).

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
These two versions of Windows XP are very similar: Microsoft has disabled a few features in Home Edition and made a few cosmetic changes. Here are the major differences:
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Backup</B>  The Microsoft Backup program comes with both editions, but must be <A HREF="../backup/4.htm#2">installed separately</A> in Windows XP Home Edition.
<LI >
<B>Multiprocessor support</B>  Home Edition supports only a single processor (CPU). Luckily, the vast majority of computers have only one processor. However, users of high-end scientific and analytical work need to install Professional.
<LI >
<B>Domain-based network support</B>  Home Edition cannot log onto a domain-based network. The networks within most large organizations use domains, so Home Edition won't suffice for corporate workstations. However, small-office and home users can use Home Edition on smaller workgroup-based <A HREF="../lans/index.htm">peer-to-peer</A> networks.<B></B>
<LI >
<B>User administration</B>  Professional has a more flexible system of user accounts and more settings you can change. Home Edition enables you to set up <A HREF="../users/index.htm">accounts for each user of the computer</A> and choose whether they are administrative (with the ability to give any command) or limited (within all administrative privileges).<B></B>
<LI >
<B>File Encryption</B>  Home Edition doesn't support <A HREF="../users/2.htm#6">file or folder encryption</A> on NTFS-formatted disks.<B></B>
<LI >
<B>Remote Desktop</B>   Home Edition doesn't include this Web-based application (also called Terminal Server client), which enables you to see the desktop of another computer on your own.<B></B>
<LI >
<B>Offline Files And Folders</B>  Home Edition doesn't support this feature, which allows you to copy files from a server to a laptop before going on the road, and then synchronizing the files when you reconnect to the network.<B></B>
<LI >
<B>Upgrades</B>  You can't upgrade from Windows NT or 2000 to Windows XP Home Edition, only to Professional. You can upgrade from Windows 98 or Me to either version of Windows XP.<B></B>
</UL>

This edition of Windows XP adds support for the Intel Itanium processor family. These processors are used on high-end engineering, scientific, and graphics workstations.

<P>
These versions of Window are, as the names imply, designed to run on servers rather than on workstations. That is, they are designed to provide servers to other computers on a network rather than being used for day-to-day work by someone sitting at the keyboard. They are based on Windows XP, but include these additional features:
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Slower performance as workstations</B>  These editions are optimized for network services, not for workstation performance.
<LI >
<B>Support for server software</B>  Many server programs, such as Microsoft Exchange, Advanced Server Pages, and SQL Server, require Windows .NET Server or Advanced Server, and don't run on Windows XP Home Edition or Professional.
<LI >
<B>Clustering</B>  Servers can be linked together into clusters to handle large network demands.
