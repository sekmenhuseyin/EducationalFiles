<P>
Remote Desktop allows you to have access to the desktop of one computer while you are running another. Not only can you see and use all the files on the remote computer, you can actually see the desktop and run programs as if you were sitting in front of the remote computer. If the remote computer is running Windows .NET, 2000, or NT Server, more than one person can use the remote computer at the same time.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/note.png" ALT="note" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=29></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">You can also access a computer remotely using <A HREF="../chatting/2.htm#1">NetMeeting</A>. If you're familiar with NetMeeting, and your needs are not sophisticated, it might be a simpler solution. Other remote-access programs have been available for years, including pcAnywhere (at <A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/pcanywhere"><B>http://www.symantec.com/pcanywhere</B></A>) and the freeware VNC (Virtual Network Computing, at <A HREF="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc"><B>http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc</B></A>).

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Remote Desktop uses a LAN, a VPN (virtual private network), or the Internet to access the remote computer--the speed of response will depend on the speed of your connection.
<P>
The <A NAME="ddserver"><I>server</I></A> is the computer that you will be taking control of from a remote location. Usually, the server computer in the Remote Desktop application is the computer on your desk--the one that you will not be taking with you. You can also use Remote Desktop to connect to a Remote Access Server (RA Server) on a Windows .NET, 2000, or NT machine. The <A NAME="ddclient"><I>client</I></A> computer is the one that you will use while you are away to see the desktop of the server computer.
<P>
Remote Desktop comes in two flavors--regular Remote Desktop and Remote Desktop Web Connection. The first requires that you install software on the client computer (the computer that you use to access the computer back on your desk). The second needs only Internet Explorer, but it requires more setup on the server computer (the computer that you access from another location).
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/note.png" ALT="note" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=29></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">A computer running Windows XP Home Edition can't act as a Remote Desktop server. That is, you can't remotely access a computer running Windows XP Home Edition. However, you can use a computer running Home Edition as the Remote Desktop client.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Before you leave the computer you want to access remotely (the server), get Remote Desktop configured and working--you should also test it before you leave. For example, if you want to be able to use your office desktop computer remotely while you are traveling, be sure to configure it for Remote Desktop before you leave on your trip. This step is necessary whether you use either regular Remote Desktop or Remote Desktop Web connection.

<P>
To gain access using Remote Desktop, you specify one or more <A HREF="../users/index.htm">user accounts</A> on the server computer to which you want remote access. The user accounts must have passwords, so as not to leave your system open to hackers. If you normally do not use a login password, <A HREF="../users/4.htm#1">create a password for your user account</A> or create a new user account with a password solely for the purpose of using Remote Desktop. When you configure the Remote Desktop server (as described in the next section), you type the user account name when Windows asks for the Object Name in the Select Users dialog box. If you are using Remote Desktop over a domain-based LAN, you can connect using a user account on any computer on the LAN.

Click the Remote tab.
<LI  VALUE=3>
Select the Allow Users To Connect Remotely To This Computer check box in the Remote Desktop section of the dialog box. If you see a warning box about user accounts without passwords, click OK.

Click the Select Remote Users button to display the Remote Desktop users dialog box. Users with administrative accounts are automatically given access, and you can add other users.
<LI  VALUE=5>
Click Add to display the Select Users dialog box shown in Figure 15-4. User accounts have three identifiers: Object Type, Location, and Name.
<LI  VALUE=6>
To specify a user account from the computer you are sitting at, leave the Select This Object Type box set to Users, and type an account name in the Enter The Object Names To Select box.  To specify a user account from another computer on a domain-based LAN, click the Locations button and choose the domain before you specify the user account name.

<TD VALIGN="TOP">An <A NAME="ddobjecttype"><I>object type</I></A> is nothing mysterious--it specifies the type of resource, user account, or group account for which you want to establish remote access. To give a user account remote access, leave the Object Type box set to Users. Other types are Computers, Printers, and groups of users, computers, and printers. The entry in the From This Location box is also simple, though the name is rather misleading. The location does not describe the physical place that another computer inhabits, but is the name<I> </I>of that computer. To allow a user from another computer access to your computer, you type the other computer's name. In the Enter The Object Names To Select box, you can type <I>computername</I>\<I>username</I> to specify a user account on that computer (for example, SOLARIA\Rima Regas or DELL8100\Margy Levine Young).

The Remote Desktop Web Connection is part of Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) component of Windows, which comes with Windows XP Professional (but not Windows XP Home Edition). When you install it, Windows copies the necessary files to your C:\Windows\Web\TSWeb folder (assuming that Windows is installed on C:)--<A NAME="ddtsweb"><I>TSWeb</I></A> stands for Terminal Services Web.
<P>
If you want to use Remote Desktop Web Connection you also need to complete these steps, which ensure that the Windows components are installed and running. These steps seem unnecessarily arcane to us, but they work. You must be logged in with an administrative user account to do the following:

If you are using the regular Remote Desktop (without the Web Connection), then the computer that you will use while you are away (the client computer) must have the Remote Desktop Connection program installed.

If you are using Remote Desktop Web Connection, the client computer that you use to access the computer on your desk must have a TCP/IP connection to the LAN or the Internet, and it must have Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher (Windows XP comes with Internet Explorer 6). No other configuration is necessary for Remote Desktop Web Connection.

Once you have completed the necessary setup tasks you are ready to test Remote Desktop. Make sure that the server machine is on and working and connected to whatever network you will use to access it--usually the Internet or a LAN (obviously, you need to do this before you leave). Sit at the client machine--that is, the computer that you will have wherever it is you are going. The next two sections describe connecting with the regular Remote Desktop and with the Remote Desktop Web Connection. Read the section for the type of connection for which you configured your computers.

<TD VALIGN="TOP">Although many users can log into a Windows XP Professional server computer remotely, if the computer is being used as a remote server, no one can be logged in locally. That is, one or more people can log in to the server computer using its own screen and keyboard, or one or more people can log in remotely, but not both. In fact, if someone is logged in locally when you try to log in remotely you see a message that lets you know that if you want to connect, the local user has to disconnect. The server also displays a message allowing the local user to prevent the remote connection, but if the person does not respond, the connection proceeds. So you can log in remotely even if you forgot to log off before you left. Windows .NET Server can act as a multiple-user server.
