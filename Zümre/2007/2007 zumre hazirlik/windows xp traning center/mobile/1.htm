If you use files from more than one computer on a regular basis, you have two options for keeping track of files that you use on your laptop, but which are normally stored on another computer: the offline files options used together with the Synchronization Manager and Windows Briefcase. Use offline files if you usually access files from a network. If you frequently transfer files using direct cable connection or a floppy disk, Briefcase may be a better option, but few people use it. Unlike offline files, Briefcase allows you to crate multiple Briefcases to organize files.

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
The other way to coordinate files saved on more than one computer is to use the Windows Briefcase, a program that coordinates files you work on, so that you always use the most current version of the files. Windows Briefcase is useful if you use a laptop when you're on the road, and a desktop machine in the office, but Briefcase is useful for anyone who uses files from several computers.
<P>
The Windows Briefcase program creates and maintains <A NAME="ddbriefcases"><I>Briefcases</I></A>, which are folders containing files and subfolders that you can move between your laptop and another computer.
<P>
The easiest way to use Briefcase to coordinate files on different computers is to have the two computers connected by a network or another connection. However, you can also use Briefcase with a floppy disk or Zip disk, although that limits the total size of the files you can move from computer to computer.
<P>
You may see a Briefcase icon on the desktop. If it doesn't appear on the desktop, right-click the desktop and choose New | Briefcase from the shortcut menu (you can use this option to create multiple briefcases). The first time you open the My Briefcase window, you also see the Welcome To The Windows Briefcase window, with tips for using the program. Click Finish when you have read the tips.

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
The most common use of Briefcase is for transferring files from a desktop to a laptop for use while away from the office, and then transferring the updated files back to the desktop when you return. Using Briefcase to transfer files has four steps:
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=1>
Move files to the Briefcase. Choose only the files you will use and update while you're away from your desktop computer.
<LI  VALUE=2>
Copy the Briefcase to the laptop.
<LI  VALUE=3>
Use files from the Briefcase while you are on the road using the laptop.
<LI  VALUE=4>
When you are ready to work at your desktop again, tell Briefcase to synchronize the files on the two computers, so both computers contain the latest version of each file in the Briefcase.
</OL>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/note.png" ALT="note" WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=29></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">Briefcase uses the system time and date to synchronize files--make sure the time and date on each computer is correct.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
These steps are somewhat different, depending on whether a local area network (LAN) connects the laptop and desktop computers. Without a LAN connection, you have to use a floppy disk (or disks) to move the Briefcase to the laptop. With a LAN, you can sit at the laptop and drag files from the desktop to the laptop's Briefcase.

</TR>
</TABLE></A>
<P>
The first step is to find the files you want to have on the road and drag them to your Briefcase. The easiest way to do this is to select files in Windows Explorer and drag them to the Briefcase icon or window. You can do this in several steps as you select files in different folders on your hard disk. You can also right-click a file and choose Send To | My Briefcase from the shortcut menu.
<P>
You move files differently if the laptop and desktop computers are connected by a LAN--sit at the laptop and drag files from a drive located on the desktop computer to the laptop's Briefcase.
<P>
If you don't have a LAN, you need to complete twoextra steps:
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=1>
Sit at the desktop and drag the files you need to the Briefcase icon on the desktop, or the Briefcase window if it's open.
<LI  VALUE=2>
Drag the Briefcase to a floppy drive or right-click the Briefcase and choose Send To | Floppy (choosing the drive where you want to move the Briefcase).

<P>
If your desktop and laptop computers are connected by a LAN, the Briefcase with the files you need is still on the desktop computer, where it will do you no good when you leave the office. If you have a LAN, skip this section, because the Briefcase with the files you need is already on the laptop. Also skip this section if you want to use the Briefcase files from the floppy disk. However, using a floppy instead of the hard disk will slow you down noticeably if you are using large files.
<P>
To copy the Briefcase with its files to the laptop's hard drive, follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI  VALUE=1>
Take the disk to which you copied the Briefcase, insert it in the floppy drive of the laptop, and view the contents of the drive. You see the Briefcase icon.
<LI  VALUE=2>

When you see the Properties dialog box for the file, click the Update Status tab.
<LI >
If you drag a file from another location into the Briefcase, you can find the original copy of this file. In the Properties dialog box for the file on the Update Status tab, click the Find Original button. Windows displays the folder containing the original file in an Explorer window.
<LI >
You can sever the connection between the original file and the copy of the file in the Briefcase--for example, if the copy in the Briefcase has changed sufficiently that you also want to keep the original copy.

Reestablish the connection between the two computers. If you have a <A HREF="../mobile/5.htm#1">docking station that supports hot docking</A> (installing or removing the computer in the docking station without turning the computer off), the Briefcase may open automatically. If you don't have a LAN, move Briefcase from the laptop's desktop back to the floppy disk, take the floppy disk to the original computer, and then move the Briefcase back to the original computer's desktop.
<LI  VALUE=2>
Open the Briefcase window. You see the status of each file in the Status column. (Choose View | Details if this column doesn't appear.) A file's status can be one of the following three:
</OL>
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Orphan</B>  The file exists only in the Briefcase and not on the source computer (in this example, the desktop computer is the source computer).

<OL>
<LI  VALUE=3>
Click the Update All button on the Briefcase toolbar. The Update My Briefcase dialog box appears, showing how each file needs to be updated, as shown in Figure 15-3. A file can be updated in one of the following ways:
</OL>
<UL>
<LI >
<B>Replace, with an arrow pointing to the right</B>  This is the most common action. It means the file in the Briefcase will replace the file of the same name on the desktop computer.
<LI >
<B>Replace, with an arrow pointing to the left</B>  This means the file on the desktop computer is the most recent--it will replace the file of the same name in the Briefcase.
<LI >
<B>Skip (both changed)</B>  This means both files (the one on the desktop and the one on the laptop) have been changed and Briefcase can't determine which file should be used. You need to determine which version of the file you want to use.
</UL>
