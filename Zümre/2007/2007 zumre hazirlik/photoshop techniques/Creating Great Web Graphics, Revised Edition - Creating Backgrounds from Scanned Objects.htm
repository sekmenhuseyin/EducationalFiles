    <TD bgColor=#ffffff><FONT face="comic sans ms">Using a flatbed scanner, 
      you can use virtually any object that will fit onto the scanner as a 
      background for your web page. The example below shows just a few of the 
      amazing possibilities that ordinary objects offer for creative 
      backgrounds. 
      <P>

      src="Creating Great Web Graphics, Revised Edition - Creating Backgrounds from Scanned Objects_files/ch4-023.jpg" 
      width=380></CENTER>
      <P>The objects used in the examples above include, from left to right, a 
      bit of fabric, a handful of plastic "jewels" from a craft supply store, a 
      swatch of handmade paper, a paper doily, breakfast cereal, and an 
      artichoke. Think of the infinite variety of creative backgrounds you can 
      create from household and found objects. 
      <P>Anything from a handful of costume jewelry to a scattering of leaves 
      can become a background for your web page. This tutorial does require the 
      use of a flatbed scanner. Obviously, you couldn't feed half an artichoke 
      or a handful of dry pasta through a handheld or single-sheet fed scanner. 
      I'd also suggest, if you'll be scanning messy or rough objects to protect 
      the glass on your scanner by covering it with a sheet of clear acetate, 
      available at art supply stores. You can also enclose the objects you'll be 
      scanning in a plastic bag. 
      <P>This tutorial will show you how to scan, make a simple adjustment, and 
      create a seamless background from some colorful candy.We'll be covering 
      more aspects of scanning in Chapter 6 of <A 
      href="http://www.mccannas.com/book/overview.htm">Creating Great Web 
      Graphics</A>.

      <P><FONT color=#0000cc><B>1.</B></FONT> Select File/Import, and select 
      your scanner (your scanner drivers, obviously, would need to have been 
      installed prior to this step). You'll want to scan a little larger than 
      the image will show up on your web page, so scan your objects in at about 
      120 dpi. Your scan will probably be dark, gray in tone, and have small 
      artifacts (what I call glitches) visible, but that's okay. 
      <P><FONT color=#0000cc><B>2.</B></FONT> You'll fix the overall cast of the 
      image first. This image scanned in too dark, as shown above. By selecting 
      <B>Image/Adjust/Levels</B>, and dragging the right (or white) input slider 
      towards the center, you'll lighten the highlights and midtones in the 
      image. 
      <P><FONT color=#0000cc><B>3.</B></FONT>Select <B>Image/Offset</B> with the 
      Horizontal and Vertical amounts set to about half of your file size. Make 
      sure that the <B>Wrap Around</B> radio button is selected. 
      <P><FONT color=#0000cc><B>4.</B></FONT> There's a gap in the image, so I 
      selected a portion of the image, feathered the selection using 
      <B>Select/Feather</B>, then copied (Control+C on Windows, Command+C on the 
      Mac) the selection, and pasted the selection (Control+V on Windows, 
      Command+V on the Mac) to cover the blank area. Paint out any glitches in 
      your image using the paintbrush, and resize the image by selecting 
      <B>Image/Image Size</B> and changing the pixel size.
