            <P><B>What is Serial ATA and why is it being 
            developed?</B><BR>Serial ATA is an evolutionary replacement for the 
            Parallel ATA physical storage interface. Serial ATA is scalable and 
            will allow future enhancements to the computing platform.</P>
            <P><B>Previous efforts to transition to a serial bus were not 
            successful. Why do you believe that Serial ATA will be 
            successful?</B><BR>Serial ATA is a drop-in solution in that it is 
            compatible with today's software, which will run on the new 
            architecture without modification. It will provide for systems which 
            are easier to design, with cables that are simple to route and 
            install, smaller cable connectors, improve silicon design, and lower 
            voltages which alleviate current design requirements in Parallel 
            ATA.</P>
            <P><B>Will there still be a parallel ATA bus when Serial ATA 
            comes&nbsp;out?</B><BR>Serial ATA's adoption by the industry will 
            follow a phased transition path. There will be a point where both 
            Parallel and Serial ATA capabilities are available.</P>
            <P><B>You stated that PCs implementing Serial ATA will be in the 
            marketplace in 2002. Why does it take so long to 
            implement?</B><BR>The goal of the working group is to ensure the 
            Serial ATA transition happens as smoothly and quickly as possible. 
            The Serial ATA specification is expected to be complete in the fall 
            of 2000 with adoption to happen in the following 12 to 18 
months.</P>
            <P><B>What are the end user benefit of Serial ATA?</B><BR>End users 
            will benefit by being able to easily upgrade their storage devices. 
            Configuration of Serial ATA devices will be much simpler, with many 
            of today's requirements on jumper and settings no longer needed.</P>
            <P><B>What is the cost to implement Serial ATA in a 
            system?</B><BR>The cost of Serial ATA technology will be on par with 
            today's Parallel ATA technology.</P>
            <P><B>Who are the members of the Serial ATA Working Group? Can new 
            companies join?</B><BR>The Serial ATA promoters group includes APT 
            Technologies Inc, Dell Computer Corporation, International Business 
            Machines, Intel Corporation, Maxtor Corporation, Quantum 
            Corporation, and Seagate Technology. Information on joining the 
            working group is available at <A 
            href="http://www.serialata.org/index.shtml">http://www.serialata.org/index.shtml</A> 
            and new members are welcome.</P>
            <P><B>Hard disk data rates don't seem to be pushing the limits of 
            current ATA66 technology. Why is Serial ATA being planned 
            now?</B><BR>Serial ATA is an evolutionary replacement for the 
            Parallel ATA physical storage interface and will allow future 
            enhancements to the computing platform. Specifically, the thinner 
            Serial ATA cable addresses OEM's concerns regarding airflow around 
            the Parallel ATA cable, and enables design of smaller PC chassis, as 
            well as silicon vendors concerns regarding 5 volt tolerance support 
            in future designs.</P>
            <P><B>Will Serial ATA be compatible with today's PCs?</B><BR>Serial 
            ATA electronics and connectors will differ from Parallel ATA, 
            however the technology is software compatible and OS transparent. It 
            is anticipated that there will be adapters to facilitate forward- 
            and backward-compatibility of hard disks on PC systems.</P>
            <P><B>What is the impact of Serial ATA on OEMs?</B><BR>Industry 
            benefits of Serial ATA include systems which are easier to design 
            with cables that are simple to route and install, smaller cable 
            connectors with improved silicon design, lower voltage which 
            alleviates current design requirements in Parallel ATA and 
            compatibility with today's software which will run on the new 
            architecture without modification.</P>
            <P><B>Beyond hard disks, will Serial ATA be used on floppy drives, 
            optical drives, DVDs, and ZIP drives?</B><BR>Serial ATA supports all 
            ATA and ATAPI devices, including CDs, DVDs, tapes devices, high 
            capacity removeable devices, zip drives, and CDRW's.</P>
            <P><B>What is the impact of Serial ATA on IEEE1394 (aka Firewire) 
            and on USB2 in terms of PC system function?</B><BR>Serial ATA is 
            planned to be the primary storage interface inside the PC system, 
            and is not planned as an external interface to PC storage or 
            peripherals. USB2 and IEEE1394 connections on the PC can be used 
            where required as peripheral interfaces.</P>
            <P><B>When does Microsoft plan to support Serial ATA in its 
            OS's?</B><BR>Serial ATA is software compatible with Parallel ATA and 
            requires no changes to Microsoft operating systems, or any other OS 
            as well.</P>
            <P><B>What are the licensing requirements and costs of Serial ATA to 
            companies that want to use the technology?</B><BR>When the Serial 
            ATA specification is complete, it will be made available at no 
            charge. The working group expects to complete the specification 
            later this year.</P><A

            <P><B>What is Serial ATA?</B><BR>Serial ATA is a disk-interface 
            technology developed by a group of the industry's leading vendors to 
            replace parallel ATA. The group is known as the Serial ATA Working 
            Group. The Serial ATA 1.0 specification was released in August 
            2001.</P>
            <P><B>What are the compelling reasons why Serial ATA is a viable 
            option for server and NAS networked storage?</B></P>
            <OL>
              <LI>Scalability&#8212;Serial ATA is a point-to-point connection and 
              allows multiple ports to be aggregated into a single controller 
              that is typically located either on the motherboard or as an 
              add-in, RAID card. Through backplanes and external enclosures, 
              Serial ATA will be deployed in high-capacity server and 
              networked-storage environments. 
              <LI>Price&#8212;Serial ATA was created, with desktop prices in mind, as 
              a replacement for Parallel ATA. Initial hard disk drives (HDD's) 
              are expected to be priced competitively for the desktop. With the 
              scalable features of Serial ATA combined with desktop 
              price-points, greater storage capacity may be realized at a lower 
              total solution cost than with traditional server and networked 
              storage. 
              <LI>Cabling&#8212;Serial ATA specifies a thin, point-to-point connection 
              which allows for easy cable routing within a system. This avoids 
              master/slave, "daisy-chaining", and termination issues. Also, 
              better airflow can be realized compared to systems with wider 
              ribbon cables. 
              <LI>Performance&#8212;Serial ATA technology will deliver 1.5 Gbps 
              (150&nbsp;MB/sec) of performance to each drive within a disk drive 
              array. </LI></OL>
            <P><B>When will Serial ATA infrastructure products be shipping in 
            volume?</B><BR>Individual vendors will best be able to advise on 
            product plans. However, hard disk drives, cables, enclosures, and 
            controllers are expected to be available to OEM and channel 
            customers in 2002, with enterprise system vendors shipping platforms 
            with Serial ATA storage by the second half of the year.</P>
            <P><B>Where is Serial ATA positioned relative to other interface 
            technologies?</B><BR>Serial ATA technology provides a new serial 
            interconnect designed to change the way vendors develop storage 
            systems. The first deployments, where price is an important issue, 
            are intended for entry-level servers and network-attached storage. 
            As the infrastructure continues to develop, Serial ATA will 
            penetrate into higher-end servers and more complex storage 
            systems.</P>
            <P><B>What is the long-term road map for Serial ATA?</B><BR>Serial 
            ATA defines a roadmap starting at 1.5 gigabits per second 
            (equivalent to a data rate of 150MB/s) and migrating to 3.0 gigabits 
            per second (300 MB/s), then to 6.0 gigabits per second (600 MB/s). 
            This roadmap supports up to 10 years of storage evolution, based on 
            historical trends.</P>
            <P><B>How does Serial ATA handle backward compatibility 
            issues?</B><BR>Serial ATA supports legacy drivers for Parallel ATA. 
            OEMs can deploy Serial ATA, today, using existing parallel ATA 
            drivers. Vendors intend to supply bridges for parallel-to-serial 
            conversion for legacy devices.</P>
            <P><B>Are there any known interoperability issues with Serial 
            ATA?</B><BR>One of the primary requirements of the Serial ATA 1.0 
            specification was to maintain backward compatibility with existing 
            operating system drivers to eliminate incompatibility issues.</P>
            <P><B>How will operating systems handle Serial ATA?</B><BR>Because 
            of the legacy support inherent in the specification, operating 
            support will be simplified. The Serial ATA specification allows for 
            additional features to be added to applications. Additional features 
            will be subject to normal driver validation processes.</P>
            <P><B>How does the end-user benefit from using Serial ATA technology 
            in servers and NAS?</B><BR>The end-user will benefit from lower 
            cost, higher performance (via increased speed and scalability), and 
            easier configuration. Serial ATA allows for higher performance while 
            using existing, proven features such as 3.5" disk drives. 
            Configuration of Serial ATA devices will eliminate many of today's 
            requirements for jumpers and settings.</P>
            <P><B>How does the system vendor benefit from using Serial ATA 
            technology in servers and NAS?</B><BR>Benefits for the OEM:</P>
