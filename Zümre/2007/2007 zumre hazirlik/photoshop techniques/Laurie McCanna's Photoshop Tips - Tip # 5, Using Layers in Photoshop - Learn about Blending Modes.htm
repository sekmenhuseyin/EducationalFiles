      <H3>Using Layers in Photoshop - Experimenting with Composite Modes</H3>
      <P></FONT></CENTER><FONT face="comic sans ms" size=3>The following 
      Photoshop Tip will help you to understand layers and composite modes 
      (hopefully!) a little better. Also, learn how to fill an area in Photoshop 
      with a pattern. 
      <P><FONT color=#008080><B>1. </B></FONT>Open the file you'll be using as a 
      pattern reference. You can <A 
      href="http://www.mccannas.com/free/tiles.zip">download </A>a zipped 
      collection of background tiles, or use your own texture or photograph for 
      this example. In the example below, I've used tile14.gif as the pattern 
      fill. 
      <P><FONT color=#008080 size=4><B>2. </B></FONT>Using the pattern file, 
      select all (<B>Ctrl+A</B> on Windows, <B>Command+A</B> on the Mac), and go 
      to the <B>Edit</B> menu. Select <B>Define Pattern</B>. 
      <P><FONT color=#008080 size=4><B>3. </B></FONT>Now we'll create a new 
      file, 200 x 100 pixels. Make sure that the Layers palette is visible. You 
      can open the palette by selecting <B>Window/Show Layers</B>.With a dark 
      green as a foreground color, type the word "NEW!" on the background layer. 
      (I've used Futura Extra Black at 60 points in the example, but any bold 
      font will work.) Then deselect the type (<B>Ctrl+D</B> on Windows, 
      <B>Command+D</B> on the Mac).

      <P><FONT color=#008080 size=4><B>4. </B></FONT>Using the little flyout on 
      the Layers palette, select New Layer. Title this layer "pattern". 
      <P><FONT color=#008080 size=4><B>5. </B></FONT>From the Edit menu, select 
      Fill. Make sure that the type of fill is <B>Pattern,</B> set to 100% 
      opacity and Normal mode. 
      <P><FONT color=#008080 size=4><B>6. </B></FONT>Now, some fun stuff. Drag 
      the opacity slider to about 50%, and you'll be able to see the type from 
      the background layer. We are going to play around with the way the pattern 
      interacts with the layer beneath it. If you change the setting from 
      <B>Normal</B> to:
