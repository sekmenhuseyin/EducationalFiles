		<font size="2">Because it affects university life and as a result a good 
		career, high school life is very important. High school students are 
		ready to get everything they are taught. Students who get good education 
		in high school may get a place at a good university and as a result have 
		a good job in their future. We are not a newly-established school. We 
		have been teaching kids from kindergarten to high school students for 10 
		years and we have already won Albanian people’s trust. So far 850 
		students have already graduated and are still studying in universities 
		of 21 countries. Our board of teachers and administration are making 
		every endeavor to give the best education to your children who you have 
		entrusted us and to prepare them for life.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">- Students get the right to enroll in our school after a 
		competition done among more than 1000 8<sup>th</sup> class pupils 
		allover Albania.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">In the 9th class students learn 2 languages, English and 
		Turkish, and they also take science lessons, like maths, physics, 
		chemistry and biology. In the upper classes science subjects are taught 
		in English, while social subjects are taught in Albanian. A student who 
		graduates from our school can understand and speak English and Turkish 
		very fluently and can also communicate in German, which is taught in the 
		11 and 12 classes. To be in touch with this age’s latest technology, 
		computer knowledge is taught the best way possible.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">- Besides education we try to offer accommodation to 
		students who come from other regions outside Tirana.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">- Being an institution that Albania’s distinguished 
		people choose, with our qualified board and contemporary education 
		methods we will try to always do our best for Albania. </font></span>

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
