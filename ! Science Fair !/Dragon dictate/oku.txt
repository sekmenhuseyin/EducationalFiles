DragonDictate was the original speech recognition application from Dragon Systems and uses discrete speech where "you - pause - between - each - word - that - you - say".

Dragon NaturallySpeaking allows continuous speech recognition.

DragonDictate is still available but has not been updated since Windows 98 was the current operating system.

Some historical information on DragonDictate can be found in the article on Dragon NaturallySpeaking.
